# Romans 

## Chapter 1

### Παῦλος

In the culture of this time, letter writers would give their own names first. Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul”

### δοῦλος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, κλητὸς ἀπόστολος	

These two phrases give further information about Paul. He describes himself as being someone whom God has given the position and authority of being Christ’s **servant** and **apostle**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “a person whom God has made a servant of Christ Jesus, and whom he has called to represent him”
