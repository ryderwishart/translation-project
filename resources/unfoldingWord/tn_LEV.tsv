The people were to obey all of these laws to honor their covenant with God.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\n“Leviticus” means “about the Levites.” The Levites were the tribe of Israel that provided priests and other workers in the tabernacle. If the people in the project language do not understand the term “Levites,” you can call it “The Book about the Priests” or “The Book about the Tabernacle Workers.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Leviticus?\n\n### What is the meaning of “holy” and “holiness” in the book of Leviticus?\n\nThese terms concern separating someone or something from the rest of the people, from the world, or from ordinary use. God separated these people or things so they would belong only to him. The people were to consider as separate the places for worshiping God or for honoring him in any way. The people could not use them for anything else. God required the Israelites to live in a certain way in order to live as a nation belonging to him alone.\n\nAnyone or anything that was acceptable to God or “holy” was spoken of as if it were physically clean. In the same way, anyone or anything that was not acceptable to God or not holy was spoken of as if it were physically unclean.\n\nSome people and some things could be made clean or “cleansed,” that is, made acceptable to God. People or things were made clean if the people performed the appropriate sacrifices and ceremonies. For example, some foreigners who wished to live among the Israelites and worship Yahweh could be made clean. However, other people and things could never be made acceptable to him.\n\nIt is important to know that not all unclean things or conditions were sinful. For example, after giving birth to a male child, a woman would be unclean for 33 days. Then the proper animal sacrifice would be offered for her. The monthly flow of blood made the woman unclean ([Leviticus 12:7](../../lev/12/07.md)). But Leviticus never suggests that someone with a flow of blood was sinning. In the same way, God did not allow the Israelites to eat certain kinds of animals; this was one way of setting his people apart.\n\nBecause God does not sin, the terms “holy” and “holiness” often suggest this same idea. Something belonging to God is holy. Because people must respect God, they must respect the things that belong to him.\n\n### What are the important narrative features of Leviticus?\n\nOn 17 occasions, the phrase “The Lord said to Moses” (and sometimes Aaron) is used to begin paragraphs. God and Moses frequently spoke to others. The verb “speak” is used 38 times.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the “tent of meeting”\n[TEXT]\n\n### Why did the Israelites need so many rules about sacrificing animals?\n\nLeviticus shows that God is holy. That means God is very different from humanity and the rest of the created world. God does not sin. Because of this, it is impossible to be acceptable to him without being “cleansed.” The various kinds of sacrifices were meant to make people and things acceptable to God. However, the people had to continue making animal sacrifices so that they would continue to be acceptable to God. This was a sign that pointed to a need for a better sacrifice. They needed a sacrifice that would cause them to be acceptable to God forever. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Why was the priesthood important in the book of Leviticus?\n\nPriests were individuals who went to God on behalf of the people. God authorized the priests to bring the Israelite’s sacrifices to himself.\n\n### How did the Israelite’s rules for worshiping God and sacrificing animals differ from rules of the other nations at that time?\n\nIt was common for other nations to sacrifice animals to their idols. But, the other nations did other things to worship their false gods. For instance, people would sleep with prostitutes at the temple of their gods. They did this to try to persuade their gods to bless their land with the ability to grow crops. Also, people of other nations would sometimes offer human sacrifices to their gods. The God of Israel did not allow his people to do these kinds of things.\n\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### “the sons of Aaron”\nAt the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the “sons of Aaron.” But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants.” If it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors. However, in chapters 8–10, only the literal sons of Aaron are in view, so the term “sons” would be appropriate there.\n\n### “To the face of Yahweh”\nThroughout the book as a whole, the author of Leviticus uses the common idiom “to the face of Yahweh” as a metaphor that means “where Yahweh can see” or “in the sight” or “in the presence of Yahweh,” similar to the English preposition “before.” Sight, in turn, means attention, perspective, and judgment. In the context of Leviticus, "in the presence" or "sight of Yahweh" means to be within the sacred precincts of the tent of meeting. You can translate this expression as “from Yahweh’s perspective,” “in Yahweh's presence,” or simply as “before Yahweh.”\n\n### “Unblemished” or “perfect”\nWhen the book of Leviticus calls something "perfect" (in the ULT), it refers to a sacrificial animal that is the best representative animal of that species. As such, the word "perfect" refers to wholeness, completeness, and perfection. This is often translated with negative terms like “unblemished.” If it would be more natural in your language, consider using terms that carry these same meanings. Alternate translation: “a whole male” or “a complete male” or “a healthy male” \n\n### What important symbols are introduced in Leviticus?\nOil was poured on someone or something meant to be set apart for Yahweh. Water was used to symbolize the cleansing of someone or something so God could accept them. Blood was also used to cleanse and purify people and things. This is because blood represented the life that needed to be shed in order for God to forgive people for sinning.\n\n### Why do many sections begin with the phrase “Yahweh said to Moses”?\nThis phrase shows the reader that these rules come from God and must be obeyed. You could also translate this as “God told Moses.”
1:intro	ecv8				0	#Leviticus 1 General Notes\n\n##Structure and Formatting\nIn Hebrew, this chapter begins with the word “And,” indicating a connection with the previous book (Exodus). This connection not only implies that the first five books of the Bible should be seen as a single unit; it also situates Leviticus in the narrative setting of the book of Exodus, during the thirteenth month of the Israelite's wandering in the wilderness of Sinai. \n\nThe first chapter of Leviticus is comprised of two hypothetical scenarios representing three variations of the burnt offering:\nThe Burnt Offering (1:1–17)\n- 1) a livestock animal ([1:2–13](../01/02.md))\n     - a) a bovine ([1:3–9](../01/03.md))\n     - b) a sheep or goat ([1:10–13](../01/10.md))\n- 2) a bird ([1:14–17](../01/14.md))\n\nAs such, the initial heading verse of each section begins with "If" and is followed by the prescribed steps of the sacrifice. Presumably, they are the same for each burnt offering, but more prescriptions are explicit for the first type of burnt offering, the bovine, probably because they are implied for the other two possible burnt offerings. The steps of the sacrificial process for burnt offerings are:\n\n- 1) Selecting a perfect, unblemished, and otherwise completely healthy animal ([1:3, 10, 14](../01/03.md))\n- 2) Presenting the animal at the entrance to the tent of meeting ([1:3](../01/03.md))\n- 3) Laying hands on the head of the animal ([1:4](../01/04.md))\n- 4) Killing the animal ([1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md))\n- 5) Presenting and sprinkling the animal's blood on the altar ([1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md))\n- 6) Skinning the animal ([1:6](../01/06.md))\n- 7) Butchering the animal into its appropriate pieces, usually the head, fat, intestines, and legs ([1:6, 12, 16–17](../01/06.md))\n- 8) Putting fire on the altar and arranging the wood ([1:7](../01/07.md))\n- 9) Arranging the pieces, specifically the head and the fat, of the sacrifice over the burning wood of the altar ([1:8, 12](../01/08.md))\n- 10) Washing the legs and the intestines ([1:9, 13](../01/09.md))\n- 11) Burning the entire animal in a way that causes smoke to go up ([1:9, 13, 17](../01/09.md)\n\n##Special Concepts in this Chapter\nSeveral concepts are crucial for understanding the instructions in this chapter. They include: 1) technical sacrificial terminology, 2) atonement, 3) the importance of blood, and 4) the nature of symbolic action. \n\n###Technical sacrificial terminology\nThroughout the book of Leviticus, the author employs several terms that have a specialized technical meaning in the context of sacrifices or that are only used in this context. In this chapter, such terms are 1) the "burnt offering" and 2) the "gift."\n\n- 1) The “burnt offering”\nThe burnt offering was a particular sacrifice that could be offered by anyone for a variety of reasons. Its name is related to a verb that means "to go up" or ”to ascend,” suggesting that the sacrifice was to be converted into smoke by the fire and ascend to Yahweh in heaven, as the discussion on the verb phrase "to cause to become smoke" will suggest. Its function was to provide a sacrifice intended to bring about forgiveness for a wide variety of sins and unintentional mistakes that were not specifically covered by the other sacrifices discussed in the first seven chapters of Leviticus. The sacrifice required a perfect, male animal that would be completely burned on the altar over a fire that was to be kept burning continually (see [6:9–13](../06/09.md) for more details ). The sacrifice, when accepted by Yahweh, would provide "atonement" for the individual who offered it. \n\n- 2) The “gift” or “offering made by fire”\nThe word translated "gift" in [1:9, 13, and 17](../01/09.md) is variously translated in modern English versions, usually with reference to ”an offering made by fire,” based on the word's presumed relationship with the word for ”fire.” However, some of the sacrifices referred to by this word are not burned on the altar (like the portions of the sacrifices that belonged to the priests in [7:30, 35–36](../07/30.md)), and many sacrifices, such as the purification offering, that are burned on the altar are not referred to by this term. Instead, this term simply refers to a "gift" offered to Yahweh that consists of food items. While you may see the phrase ”fire offering” or ”offering made by fire” in modern English translations, we suggest that you retain the term "gift." \n\n###Atonement\nThe word translated "atone" in the ULT is a technical term expressing the act of atonement that was carried out by the priest but always accomplished by Yahweh. Traditionally, it has been understood as a metaphor with the basic meaning of “to cover,” but more recently, some scholars have understood it to express the image of “to wipe.” If the former is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the sacrifice as covering up the defiling impurity caused by sin. If the latter is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the animal as a sort of ritual detergent that cleanses the person or object from the defiling presence of sin's impurity. Either way, the sacrifice offered by the priest on behalf of the individual or community is accepted in order to restore the relationship between the individual or community and Yahweh that has been damaged or defiled because of sin. This is why so many of the instructions concerning sacrifice end with the mention of the forgiveness of sins, which was the means by which the relationship with Yahweh could be restored. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/atonement]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]]). \n\n###The importance of blood \nIn Leviticus 1, the "blood" of the animal is collected and applied via sprinkling or splattering to the sides of the altar upon which the burnt offering is placed (see [1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md)). This act, as explained above, has been variously understood, but pictures the blood as cleansing the altar from the effects of sin. Blood was able to cleanse sacred space and God's people from the impurities of sin because of its ability to accomplish atonement by means of "the life" of the animal (see ([17:10–12](../17/10.md)). Because the blood contained "the life" of the animal, Yahweh forbade the eating of any animal blood (see ([7:26–27](../07/26.md), ([17:10–14](../17/10.md), and ([19:26](../19/26.md)). \n\n###Ritual or symbolic action\nThree actions in this chapter and throughout Leviticus are symbolic in nature and picture important theological realities. \n\n- 1) The language of "presenting" throughout this chapter means not only bringing the sacrifice to the altar or to the priest, but also displaying the sacrifice "to the face of Yahweh," that is, to Yahweh himself. This pictures the reality that these sacrifices were performed in the presence of Yahweh, literally in the vicinity of the sacred precincts where Yahweh lived among the Israelites while they were in the wilderness. \n\n- 2) This chapter features the symbolic act of laying one's hands on the head of the sacrificial animal. This action is linked to the acceptance of the animal as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf (see ([1:4](../01/04.md)). As a symbolic act, the laying of hands apparently identifies the individual with the animal he is offering. The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed.\n\n- 3) The language of "causing the sacrifice to become smoke on the altar" pictures the sacrifice as being converted to smoke by the fire of the altar and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the pleasant aroma of the burning sacrifice. As such, the pleasant smell was either a sign that Yahweh approved the sacrifice and would atone for the individual's sins and forgive him, or it functioned as a necessary requirement for the acceptance of the individual's offering. \n\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\nThis chapter includes three primary figures of speech that may prove difficult to translate but are important to understanding the chapter. These include 1) the phrase, "to the face of Yahweh," 2) the phrase, "a pleasing smell to Yahweh," and 3) the way of referring to the priests as "the sons of Aaron." \n\n###“To the face of Yahweh”\nThroughout this chapter and the book as a whole, the author of Leviticus uses the common idiom “to the face of Yahweh” as a metaphor that means “where Yahweh can see” or “in the sight” or “in the presence of Yahweh,” similar to the English preposition “before.” Sight, in turn, means attention, perspective, and judgment. In the context of Leviticus, "in the presence" or "sight of Yahweh" means to be within the sacred precincts of the tent of meeting, either in the sense of the location directly in front of the tent in which Yahweh resided (see [1:3, 12](../01/03.md)), or in the sense of being in the presence of Yahweh within the precincts of the tent of meeting (see [1:5](../01/05.md)). You can translate either sense of this expression as “in the presence of Yahweh" or simply as ”before Yahweh.”\n\n###“Pleasing smell to Yahweh”\nAs mentioned previously, throughout this chapter, the priest is instructed to cause the sacrifice to become smoke on the altar. This refers to burning the sacrifice in a way that causes smoke to go up, picturing the sacrifice as being converted to pleasant-smelling smoke by the fire and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the smoke and be pleased. That the sacrifice was accompanied by the gift of the pleasant-smelling smoke of the sacrifice was apparently crucial to the acceptance of the offering as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf, as it is mentioned several times in this chapter (see [1:9, 13, 17](../01/09.md)). \n\n###"The sons of Aaron"\nThroughout Leviticus, but especially in this chapter, the priests are referred to by the expression "the sons of Aaron." Occasionally, the expression is "the sons of Aaron, the priests" (as in [1:5, 8, 11](../01/05.md)). Once in this chapter, the expression is altered to emphasize that it is Aaron who is the original priest, through the phrase "the sons of Aaron" (see 1:7](../01/07.md)). As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the “sons of Aaron,” who was the first high priest. But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's descendants (with the exception of Leviticus chapters 8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use the term “descendants,” which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.\n\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\nIn addition to these important figures of speech, this chapter features several translation difficulties, including 1) the unclear referent of pronouns, 2) the switching between second and third-person address, 3) the use of a verb and a related noun (cognate-accusatives), 4) the use of a future form to indicate a request or command, and 5) the use of specific, technical sacrificial language. \n\n###The referent of the pronouns\nThroughout this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses a third-person pronoun to refer to both the individual who offers the sacrifices and to the priest who performs the sacrifice. As such, it is often difficult (but not impossible) to infer which party performs which actions. In general, the sacrifice is presented to the priest, but the individual who presents the sacrifice is responsible for killing, properly butchering, and presenting the portions of the sacrificial animal to the priest, who will then arrange them on the altar's fire. The only exception to this pattern can be found in the instruction for offering a bird ([1:14–17](../01/14.md)), which specifies that it is the priest who brings the bird to the altar ([1:14](../01/14.md)) before, presumably, completing the preparation for its being burned on the altar as a burnt offering. When there is ambiguity in which party is the proper referent of the pronoun, the notes will specify who is being referred to. \n\n###Second and third-person address\nThe entirety of chapters 1 through 7 are written as direct addresses to the people of God through Moses. As mentioned previously, chapter 1 describes two hypothetical scenarios when an individual might offer three variations of the burnt offering. However, the form of the verb used to refer to the individual in this chapter varies in the second verse ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Initially, Yahweh addresses "a man from you" in the third-person, but then switches to a second-person address ("you shall offer") to indicate the imperatival force of the statement. The ensuing string of third-person verbs ([1:3–17](../01/03.md)) carry the same imperatival weight of the initial second-person verb. Thus, because in this chapter "his" and "he" refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh, it can be translated in the second person as it is in [1:2](../01/02.md) and as modeled by the UST. The pronoun used to refer to the individual who offers the sacrifice switches as follows:\n\n- Third-person: ”When a man from you, when he presents” ([1:2](../01/02.md))\n- Second-person: ”you shall present” ([1:2](../01/02.md))\n- Third-person: ”If his offering” ([1:3–17](../01/03.md))\n\nAs previously discussed, if the switch from third-person forms to second-person and back would be confusing in your language, consider using either the second or third-person forms throughout. The UST models use second-person forms for the entirety of this chapter, but the notes will often offer translation possibilities with third-person alternatives. \n\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, the verb "to present" is related to the noun translated "offering." If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate in this context to repeat these words in a similar manner. \n\n###The use of a future form to indicate a command\nOften in this chapter and throughout the first seven chapters of Leviticus, a future form will be used to indicate a command or instruction. For example, Lev 1:2 says, "you shall present your offering.” This is equivalent to saying, "you should present” or ”you must present.” Throughout these chapters, these forms could be translated with a modal form, as the UST models, or simply with an imperative or instruction form. \n

If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the last of these phrases first, since the last phrase gives the reason for the actions that the first two phrases describe.

The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in a footnote or in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering. He should do this to ritually place his sins on the animal”

1:5	bs53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־בֶּ֥ן הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר	1	The expression **son of** describes a person or animal that shares the essential qualities of something. Here the phrase describes this animal as **the son of the cattle** because it is a male animal that shares the distinguishing qualities characteristic of the class of bovines. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the bull” or “the bovine”

But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants” (with the exception of Leviticus chs. 8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.

The blood of the animal, being its life (see [Leviticus 17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to purify ritually and to remove sin. Here, the blood is splashed against the side of the altar to keep it free from sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book. Alternate translation: “and they shall splash the blood all around on the holy altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting in order to keep the altar clean from sin”
1:6	u7di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הִפְשִׁ֖יט	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the person making the offering.

1:6	cshr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִתַּ֥ח אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לִ⁠נְתָחֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The author of Leviticus assumes his audience will know what portions of the animal constituted **its pieces**. These would have included, but perhaps not been limited to, the legs and entrails, as [1:9](../01/09.md) suggests. If the phrase **its pieces** would not be clear in your context, consider listing what pieces these are. Alternate translation: “and he shall cut it into its appropriate portions, removing the legs and entrails”
1:6	h71g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וְ⁠נִתַּ֥ח אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לִ⁠נְתָחֶֽי⁠הָ׃	1	This expression is an emphatic construction that uses a verb and its object that come from the same root.

If the phrase **give fire** does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an expression in your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the sons of Aaron the priest will light a fire on the altar”
1:7	o3og		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֵ֖שׁ & הָ⁠אֵֽשׁ׃	1	Here, the word **fire** represents the coals that produce fire.

Alternate translation: “the one offering the sacrifice shall wash”\n
1:9	f91i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִרְחַ֣ץ	1	The implication seems to be that the worshiper must **wash** the innards and legs before the priest arranges them on the wood, as [1:8](../01/08.md) describes.

2:intro	t6wy				0	# Leviticus 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter gives instructions about how to make a grain offering. The **and** of 2:1 indicates that the instructions of Lev 1 are continuing. Yahweh continues telling Moses how the people should offer sacrifices. In outline form, the structure of the chapter can be displayed as follows: \n\n- 1) The Grain Offering (2:1–16)\n     - I. Offerings of Raw Flour (2:1–3)\n     - II. Offerings that are Baked, Pan-fried, or Deep-fried (2:4–10)\n          - i. Baked (2:4)\n          - ii. Pan-fried on the Griddle (2:5–6)\n          - iii. Deep-fried in a Pan (2:7)\n          - iv. Instruction for Offering (2:8–10)\n     - III. Instructions regarding Leaven, Honey, and Salt (2:11–13)\n          - i. Prohibition against burning leaven or honey (2:11–12)\n          - ii. Prescription for including salt (2:13)\n     - IV. Offerings of Grains (2:14–16)\n\n##Translation Issues in this Chapter\n### The number and person of pronouns\nIn the address to the Israelites, the author of Leviticus is known for abuptly switching the person, number, and occassionaly gender, of pronouns and verbal forms that refer to the person offering sacrifices. In chapter 1, it was suggested that any third-person singular pronouns that refer to the worshiper (and not to the priest) could be changed to second-person plural pronouns, based on the nature of the direct address and the presence of a second-person plural pronoun in [1:2](../01/02.md) and several times in the current chapter.\n\nThe pronouns referring to the worshiper switch person, gender, and number frequently. Verses 1–3 address the worshiper with a third-person singular pronoun. This swiches to the second-person, singular pronoun in 2:4–8. The worshiper is addressed in the third-person in verse 8, but verse 11 marks a shift to the second-person, this time in the plural. The plural pronouns continue throughout verses 11 and 12, but the author of Leviticus swtiches back to the second-person singular from verse 13 to the end of the chapter.\n\n1. Third-Person (2:1–3)\n- "...when a person [third-person, feminine singular] presents..." (2:1)\n- "...his [third-person, masculine singular] offering..." (2:1)\n- "...and he [third-person, masculine singular] shall pour ..." (2:1)\n- "...and he [third-person, masculine singular] shall put..." (2:1)\n- "...and he [third-person, masculine singular] shall bring..." (2:2)\n\n\n2. Second-Person (2:4–8)\n- "And if you [second-person, masculine singular] present..." (2:4)\n- "And if your [second-person, masculine singular] offering..." (2:5)\n- "Piece [second-person, singular imperative] it..." (2:6)\n- "...and you [second-person, masculine singular] shall pour..." (2:6)\n- "And if your [second-person, masculine singular] offering..." (2:7)\n- "And you [second-person, masculine singular] shall bring..." (2:8)\n\n\n3. Third-Person (2:8–10)\n- "And he [third-person, masculine singular] shall present..." (2:8)\n\n\n4. Second-Person (2:11–15)\n- "Any grain offering that you [second-person, masculine plural] present..." (2:11)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine plural] shall not cause to become smoke..." (2:11)\n- "You [second-person, masculine plural] shall present..." (2:12)\n- "...your [second-person, masculine singular] grain offerings..." (2:13)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] shall salt..." (2:13)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] shall not omit..." (2:13)\n- "...the covenant of your [second-person, masculine singular] God..." (2:13)\n- "...your [second-person, masculine singular] offerings..." (2:13)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] shall present..." (2:13)\n- "And if you [second-person, masculine singular] present..." (2:14)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] shall present..." (2:14)\n- "...your [second-person, masculine singular] first ripe grains..." (2:14)\n- "And you [second-person, masculine singular] shall put..." (2:15)\n- "...and you [second-person, masculine singular] shall place..." (2:15)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\nThis chapter introduces several key concepts that are relevant to proper translation, including the sacrifice of the **grain offering**, including the offering of **flour**, **oil**, and **incense**, the concept of the **memorial portion**, and the identification of **yeast** and **leaven**. \n\n### Grain offering\nThe **grain offering** was a specialized sacrifice consisting of an offering of harvest grain, usually wheat or barley. The grain offering sometimes accompanied the burnt offering (see [14:20](../14/20.md)), but it is unclear whether the grain offering provided atonement by itself, or whether it could only accomplish atonement when presented with the burnt offering or as a substitute for the purification offering for those who could not afford the animals required for that sacrifice (see [5:11–13](../05/11.md)). In any case, the grain offering could be offered ”dry“ (that is, not mixed with olive oil, see [7:10](../07/010.md)) or mixed with olive oil, or it could be baked in an oven or prepared in a griddle or pan. If the offering of grain was something baked in an oven, the prescribed offering consisted of a **loaf of unleavened bread** that had been made by kneading the flour with olive oil or a **wafer** that had been copiously covered in olive oil (see [2:4](../02/04.md)). Alternatively, grain offerings could be prepared by pan-frying the flour and olive oil on a **griddle** ([2:5](../02/05.md)) or deep-frying the flour and olive oil in a **pan** ([2:7](../02/07.md)). Furthermore, crushed portions of fresh grain that had been roasted with fire constituted an acceptable grain offer (see [2:14–16](../02/14.md)). A portion of the offering was crumbled and completely burned on the altar, resulting in pleasant-smelling smoke that rose to Yahweh in heaven. The remainder of the grain offering, however, belonged to the priests and the male descendants of Aaron for food (see [2:3, 10](../02/03.md) and [7:14–18](../07/14.md)). \n\n### Flour\nThe term translated **flour** in the ULT and **wheat flour** in the UST is the agricultural product made from the production of wheat grains (see [Exodus 29:2](../exod/29/02.md), and [2 Kings 7:16](../2kgs/07/16.md), where is it contrasted with barley). However, according to some rabbinic sources, the precise commodity referred to in this chapter and elsewhere in Leviticus is the large chunks of crushed grains that remain in the sieve after the grains have been dried, winnowed, and crushed. Since “flour” would connote the fine powder that falls through the sieve, what remains is more accurately called “grits” or “semolina” (see [1 Kings 5:2](../1kgs/05/02.md), where “grits” or “semolina” is contrasted with “flour”). However, since this culinary term is not present in many cultures, the term “flour” has been retained. We suggest that you use in your translation whatever word your language has to describe the large chunks of crushed grains that remain in the sieve after the grains have been dried, winnowed, and crushed. \n\n###Oil\nThe term translated **oil** in the ULT and **olive oil** in the UST refers to the agricultural product made from crushing large quantities of olives into a fine, smooth oil. This oil was used for cooking and baking (see [2:4–7](../02/04.md)) and for providing fuel for lanterns (see [Exod 35:8, 14–15](../exod/35/08.md)), but also retained symbolic importance as a way of anointing and dedicating sacred object (see [Genesis 28:18](../gen/28/18.md)), priests (see [Exodus 29:7](../exod/29/07.md) and [Leviticus 8:12, 30](../08/12.md) and [Leviticus 21:10](../21/10.md)), and kings (see [1 Samuel 10:1](../1sam/10/01.md) and [1 Sam 16:13](../1sam/16/13.md)). In this chapter, in addition to being present in most of the grain offerings, olive oil was presented with the grain offering in whatever form it took. \n\n###Incense\nScholarly sources suggest that the substance that was burned in ritual spaces for its fragrance was an expensive fragrant gum-resin tapped from three species of the Boswellia tree native only to southern Arabia (see Jer 6:20) and Somaliland. The burning of this substance was required with all grain offering, regardless of the manner of their preparation. Apparently, because both grain offerings and animal offerings provided a pleasing aroma to Yahweh, the addition of incense with the grain offering was to distinguish them from the animal sacrifices or burnt offerings (see chapter 1. Whereas the olive oil was to be poured all over the grain offerings, the incense was to be “placed” on top of it, apparently in a large lump. Then the raw flour (or other kind of grain offering) would be mixed together with the olive oil and the lump of incense in the priest’s hand as he took a large handful ([2:2](../02/02.md)). These ingredient would then be completely burned on the altar and converted into pleasant-smelling smoke, which, when it went up to Yahweh, would “please” Yahweh and so mark the completion of an acceptable sacrifice. \n\n###The memorial portion\nThe **memorial portion** of the grain offering refers to the portion that the priest designates will be burned completely on the altar as a sacrifice to Yahweh, as opposed to the portion which will remain over as food for the priests to eat. In the offering was raw flour, the priest would lift out a handful of the flour, mixed with olive oil, and all the incense that was place on it. If the offering was baked, pan-fried, or deep-fried, the priest would take a portion and crumble it on the altar. These portions that were designated to be burned on the altar constituted the **memorial protion** As such, this portion represented the entire offering by being completely burned on the altar. \n\n### Yeast and leaven\nIn Leviticus 2, the word **leaven** refers to a lump of dough made from flour and other common ingredients, usually salt and oil, that contains a live **leaven culture** as its raising agent in the form of wild, natural yeast. The term **yeast** refers to the microscopic organism consisting of single oval cells that reproduce by budding and are capable of converting sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the ancient world, **yeast** was a common household raising agent used in the baking of bread. However, because store-bought, commercial yeast in the form of a dried, deactivated culture that is routinely added to individual batches of dough is a modern invention, the ULT has chosen the less anachronistic term **leaven culture**. This term reflects the slow process of growing wild, naturally occurring yeast from a single, small batch of dough, forming a **leaven** that would be added to other larger batches of dough. The wild yeast in the **leaven** would multiply and fill the rest of the larger batch of dough until the entire batch was considered ”leavened.”\n\nIn Leviticus, grain offerings, whether baked or fried, that were made using **leaven** or included **leaven culture** were expressly forbidden to be burned on the altar, along with grain offerings made with honey. Instead, as Lev 2:12 expresses, grain offerings that included either **leaven culture** or **honey** could be offered as firstfruit offerings that were not burned on the altar. Eating or baking with **leaven** is proscribed during the events of the first Passover in Egypt before the Exodus and, specifically, during the annual festival of Unleavened Bread (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]]). Yahweh informs Moses that the practice of excluding **leaven** and **leaven culture** from one's diet should serve as a ”sign” and ”memorial” to the people of Israel that reminds them of God's mighty acts of salvation in the Exodus and encourages them to obey his commandements. (See Exodus 13:5-10). It should be noted that it was not always unlawful to eat food products made with **leaven** or **leaven culture**, but that the proscription only applied during special feasts and holidays associated with the Exodus.

3:intro	ur1s				0	#Leviticus 3 General Notes\n\n##Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter gives instructions about how to offer a **peace offering**. In a similar fashion to Leviticus 1, here Yahweh provides options for sacrifices of peace offerings consisting of a bovine, whether male or female (3:1–5), or a flock animal, whether a lamb (3:6–11) or a goat (3:12–16). The chapter ends with an “enduring statute,” applicable to any Israelite, regardless of age or location. This statute entails the proscription of consuming any fat or blood (3:17). In outline form, the structure of chapter 3 is as follows: \n\n\n- 1) The Peace Offering (3:1–17)\n     - I. Offering a bovine (3:1–5)\n     - II. Offering a flock animal (3:6–16)\n          - i. a sheep (3:6–11)\n          - ii. a goat (3:12–16)\n     - The proscription against eating blood or fat (3:17)\n\n##Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n###The peace offering \nThe **peace offering**, sometimes called the "restitution offering" or the "fellowship offering," CONTINUE!!\n\n- can everyone eat the peace offering?\n- what is the relationship of the peace offering to the wave offering? (cf. 7:28–34)\n- mention the thanksgiving peace offering (7:11–15), which accompanied bread and animal sacrifices, votive peace offerings and the freewill peace offerings (7:16–21). \n\n###Fat\nIn ancient times, the fat of an animal was considered the best part of the animal to eat. Therefore, the fat portions of a sacrifice belonged to Yahweh and were to be offered on the fire and converted into pleasant-smelling smoke that rose to Yahweh in heaven. The fat portions and internal organs that were to be removed for burning that are referred to in this chapter include:\n\n- 1) For bovine, sheep and goats:\n* the **fat covering the innards**, that is, the caul fat that covers all of the internal organs (see [3:3, 9, 14](../03/09.md))\n* the **fat that is on the innards**, that is, the visceral fat that is directly connected to the internal organs (see [3:3, 9, 14](../03/09.md))\n* the fat that is connected to the **two kidneys** (see [3:4, 10, 15](../03/09.md))\n* the **two kidneys** themselves (see [3:4, 10, 15](../03/09.md))\n* the **lobe on the liver**, that is, one of the four bunches of liver tissue on the animal's liver (see [3:4, 10, 15](../03/09.md))\n* the **liver** itself (see [3:4, 10, 15](../03/09.md))\n\n-2) For sheep only, in addition to the portions listed above:\n* the entirety of the **fat** of the sheep (see [3:9](../03/09.md))\n* the **fatty tail**, that is, the portion of fat attached to the short tail of the sheep, which was to be removed in one piece near the end of the spine (see [3:9](../03/09.md))\n\nThese portions of fat were to be carefully removed by the person offering the sacrifice and presented to the priest to be burned on the altar. \n\n###Sprinkling blood\nThe symbolic action of **splashing** or "sprinkling” the blood of the animal on the **the altar** is frequent in animal sacrifices in Leviticus. The blood, being the life of the animal (see [17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to purify ritually and to remove sin. In this chapter, the blood acts as a ritual detergent with the special ability to cleanse people, sacred objects, and sacred spaces from the impurity generated by sin. As such, it was splashed on the sides of the altar in a symbolic act that removed the impurities of sin.\n\n###Consuming blood or fat\nLeviticus 3:17 prohibits any Israelite, regardless of age or location, from eating any fat or blood of any animal. Because the blood contained "the life" of the animal, it had the special ability to cleanse people, sacred objects, or sacred space from the impurity caused by sin. As such, Yahweh forbid the eating of any animal blood (see ([7:26–27](../07/26.md), ([17:10–14](../17/10.md), and ([19:26](../19/26.md)). While the reason for forbidding the consumption of fat is not given in this chapter, it is presumed that these choice portions of rich fat were especially coveted and so belonged exclusively to Yahweh.

If you have been using second-person singular forms in your translation and the switch to the plural form would not be natural in your language, you could continue to use singular forms here. Alternatively, if you have been using third-person forms throughout this chapter, consider using whatever form would be clearest in your language.

4:intro	wrl4				0	#Leviticus 4 General Notes\n\n##Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter begins with a new introduction that continues the narrative framing at the beginning of the book. As such, Leviticus 4:1–5:13 should be taken as a discrete unit, continuing on from Leviticus 1–3.\n\nThis chapter gives instructions on how to offer a sacrifice for unintentional sins, called a **purification offering** because of its ability to purify the sacred space and sacred objects that are dedicated to Yahweh from the impurities generated by unintentional sin. The structure of the chapter offers can be mapped out as follows:\n\n\n- 1) The Purification Offering (4:1–5:13)\n     - I. Unintentional Sins (4:1–35)\n          - i. scenario #1: The High Priest (4:3–12)\n          - ii. scenario #2: The Community (4:13–21)\n          - iii. scenario #3: A Leader (4:22–26)\n          - iv. scenario #4: An Individual (4:27–35)\n\nThe chapter addresses four hypothetical situations where this kind of sacrifice is needed:\n\n- 1) the high priest unintentionally sins (4:3–12)\n- 2) the whole community unintentionally sins (4:13–21)\n- 3) a leader in the community unintentionally sins (4:22–26)\n- 4) an ordinary individual unintentionally sins (4:27–35)\n      - that individual offers a goat (4:27–31)\n      - that individual offers a sheep (4:32–35)\n\nAs in Leviticus 1, the instructions offer a detailed outline of the procedure for the sacrifice. The instructed steps include:\n\n- 1) presenting a perfect animal to the priest (4:3, 14)\n     - for the high priest, a young bull (4:3)\n     - for the community, a young bull (4:13)\n     - for the leader, a male goat (4:23)\n     - for the individual, a male goat (4:28) or a female sheep (4:32)\n- 2) bringing the animal to the tent of meeting (4:4, 14, 23, 28, 32)\n- 3) laying hands on the animal (4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33)\n- 4) killing the animal (4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33)\n- 5) bringing the blood into the tent of meeting (4:5, 16)\n- 6) sprinkling the blood seven times before Yahweh towards the curtain (4:6, 17)\n- 7) putting some blood on each of the four horns of an altar (4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34)\n      - for the high priest and the community, the blood is applied to the horns of the incense altar (4:7, 18)\n      - for the leader and the individual, the blood is applied to the horns of the burnt-offering altar (4:25, 30, 34)\n- 8) pouring the rest of the blood out on the base of the burnt-offering altar (4:8, 18, 25, 30, 34)\n- 9) properly butchering the animal into the fat portions (4:9–10, 19–20, 26, 31, 35)\n- 10) burning the fat portions and creating the pleasant-smelling smoke (4:10, 19–20, 26, 31, 35)\n- 11) bringing the rest of the sacrificed animal portions outside the camp to burn them (4:11–12, 21)\n\n##Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n###Unintentional sins\n[INSERT TEXT] \n\n###Guilt\n[INSERT TEXT] \n\n###Sprinkling Blood\n[INSERT TEXT] \n\n\n###The various altars and the sacred curtain\n\n###Disposing of the portions of the sacrifice that are not burned\n[INSERT TEXT] 
4:1	ymeo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר	1	The word translated **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, consider ways in which you might introduce this quotation naturally in your language.
4:1-2	vi29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר & דַּבֵּ֞ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל לֵ⁠אמֹר֒	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation, with a period before: “He told Moses to tell the sons of Israel”
4:2	gdkg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל	1	This expression speaks of the people of Israel in the time of Moses as if they were literally the **sons of Israel**. It means that they are the physical and spiritual descendants of Jacob, whose name God changed to Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel”
4:2	skxw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל	1	Although the word translated **sons** is masculine and plural, it has a generic sense that applies to both men and women. In your translation, you may wish to use a term that is clearly inclusive of men and women. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”
4:2	hgnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹר֒	1	The word translated **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, consider ways in which you might introduce this quotation naturally in your language.
4:2	wdps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	נֶ֗פֶשׁ כִּֽי־תֶחֱטָ֤א	1	Although the word translated **A person** is feminine, it has a generic sense that refers to any person who approaches the tent to make a sacrifice. As the General Introduction to this chapter suggests, the people of Israel are here referred to by using a generic feminine noun, which intentionally balances the use of the generic masculine noun in [1:2](../01/02.md). If your language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. Alternate translation: “When any person offers” or “When someone offers”
4:2	lnfi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־תֶחֱטָ֤א בִ⁠שְׁגָגָה֙ מִ⁠כֹּל֙ מִצְוֺ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר לֹ֣א תֵעָשֶׂ֑ינָה	1	The expression **which shall not be done** could refer to: (1) **the commands of Yahweh**, that is, to commandments that proscribe certain actions or behaviors. Alternate translation: “when he sins by mistake from all the commands of Yahweh that say what you should not do” or (2) the act of sinning against God by violating any of **the commands of Yahweh**. Alternate translation: “when he sins by mistake from all the commands of Yahweh, which is something that you should not do”
4:2	yyyi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־תֶחֱטָ֤א בִ⁠שְׁגָגָה֙ מִ⁠כֹּל֙ מִצְוֺ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה	1	The expression **sins by mistake from any of the commands of Yahweh** could refer to: (1) doing wrong against God by mistakenly not doing something that **the commands of Yahweh** say to do. Alternate translation: “when he sins by mistake, unintentionally not doing something that the commands of Yahweh say you should do” or (2) doing wrong against God by mistakenly doing something that the commands of Yahweh expressly forbid. Alternate translation: “when he sins by mistake by doing something that the commands of Yahweh say you should not do” 
4:2	czo5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וְ⁠עָשָׂ֕ה מֵ⁠אַחַ֖ת מֵ⁠הֵֽנָּה	1	The expression **from one from them** uses repetition to refer to any individual command from the body of the commands of Yahweh. If your language can use repetition for emphasis in this manner, consider using a similar expression here. If not, then consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “and he does any one of them”
4:3	iy0r		rc://*/ta/man/grammar-connect-logic-result	אִ֣ם הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֧ן הַ⁠מָּשִׁ֛יחַ יֶחֱטָ֖א לְ⁠אַשְׁמַ֣ת הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1	The expression **sins to the guilt of the people** refers to an act of wrongdoing against Yahweh that results in the collective guilt of the people in some way. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate explanation: “if the anointed priest sins in such a way that it causes the people to become guilty”
4:3	jsnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֧ן הַ⁠מָּשִׁ֛יחַ	1	The **anointed priest** refers to the high priest, or the member of the priest who has been anointed to lead the priesthood. If your language has a similar way of referring to a leading spiritual figure, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “the priest whom Yahweh anointed to be the high priest”
4:3	g1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠אַשְׁמַ֣ת הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1	The abstract noun **guilt** refers both to the emotional experience of feeling guilty and to the legal status of having done wrong and needing to offer restitution for the wrongdoing. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **guilt**, you can express the same idea with an adjective. Alternate translation: “so as to cause the people to be guilty”
4:3	dr8l			וְ⁠הִקְרִ֡יב	1	Alternate translation: “then he should present”
4:3	l49l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	 עַ֣ל חַטָּאת⁠וֹ֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר חָטָ֜א	1	Here, a verb and its object come from the same root. The phrase **he sinned** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated **sin**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. 
4:3	hev1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	פַּ֣ר	1	A **bull** is a domesticated, adult male ox or bullock. If your language has a word for this animal, consider using it here. If not, then consider using a generic noun. Alternate translation: “a male bovine”
4:3	w2tz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־בָּקָ֥ר תָּמִ֛ים	1	The expression **son of** describes a person or animal that shares the essential qualities of something. Here the phrase describes this **bull** as a **son of the cattle** because it is a male animal that shares the essential qualities of the class of domesticated bovines. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a perfect male bovine”
4:3	wv3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בָּקָ֥ר	1	See how you translated the word **cattle** in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “the domesticated bovines”
4:3	oklv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בָּקָ֥ר	1	The expression **the cattle** does not refer to specific groups of animals. It describes any group of bovines that an Israelite might own. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the cattle that he owns or can buy”
4:3	ixx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 תָּמִ֛ים 	1	See how you translated this word in [1:3](../01/03.md).
4:3	hxl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	 לְ⁠חַטָּֽאת׃	1	As the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, a **sin offering** is a sacrifice that was offered by an individual person or the community as a whole to purify the sacred altar, the sanctuary, and the sacred objects from impurity caused by sin. 
4:4	xx9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הֵבִ֣יא אֶת־ הַ⁠פָּ֗ר	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the anointed priest, that is, to the high priest who has unintentionally sinned and made the people guilty. If it would be helpful, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “And the anointed priest shall bring the bull”
4:4	z9am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	See how you translated the expression **to the face of Yahweh** in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “into the presence of Yahweh” or “to the sacred precincts of the tent of meeting where Yahweh lives among the Israelites”

Then he would bring the bowl with the blood in it and present it to Yahweh at the altar, before applying it to the altar in the manner that [4:6–7](../04/06.md) describes. If this would not be clear in your language, you could supply this information, here and in later instances in the book. Alternative translation: “After catching the blood in a bowl as it drains from the bull that he slaughtered, the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull”
4:5	i2aa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֥ן הַ⁠מָּשִׁ֖יחַ	1	See how you translated this way of referring to the high priest in [4:3](../04/03.md).

Alternate translation: “and he shall sprinkle some of the blood seven times toward the Holy of Holies, where Yahweh lives among the Israelites”
4:6	uk96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠הִזָּ֨ה מִן־הַ⁠דָּ֜ם שֶׁ֤בַע פְּעָמִים֙ 	1	Just as the blood is splashed against the altar in [1:5](../01/05.md) and elsewhere, here, in a similar ritual action, the high priest **sprinkles** the blood on the altar and the curtain with his finger. The blood, being the life of the animal (see [17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to purify and remove the defiling impurities caused by the high priests’ unintentional sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book. If your language has a word for sprinkling liquids in a religious context, consider using it here. Alternate translation: “and he shall sprinkle some of the blood seven times in order to clean the sacred place from the defiling impurities of sin”
4:6	z4pg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י פָּרֹ֥כֶת הַ⁠קֹּֽדֶשׁ	1	The **face of the curtain** is an idiom that means the front of the curtain. If your language has a similar idiom, consider using it here. If not, consider using a general expression. Alternate translation: “the front of the curtain”
4:6	htr0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י פָּרֹ֥כֶת הַ⁠קֹּֽדֶשׁ׃	1	The **curtain of the holy place** was a thick cloth of blue, purple, and scarlet linen that hung between the holy place of the altar and the Holy of Holies, concealing the Holy of Holies from view, as described in [Exodus 26:31–35](exod/26/31.md). If it would be helpful, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “the front of the sacred screen that separates the Holy of Holies from the rest of the tent”
4:7	c0um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠נָתַן֩ הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֨ן מִן־הַ⁠דָּ֜ם עַל־קַ֠רְנוֹת מִזְבַּ֨ח קְטֹ֤רֶת הַ⁠סַּמִּים֙	1	This is a symbolic action. By daubing the blood on the extremities of the altar, the priest is ritually removing from the sacred altar the impurities caused by the unintentional sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book. Alternate translation: “And the priest should put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of incense of the spices in order to purify the altar from the defiling impurities caused by the priest’s unintentional sin”
4:7	ykir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נָתַן֩ הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֨ן מִן־הַ⁠דָּ֜ם עַל־קַ֠רְנוֹת מִזְבַּ֨ח קְטֹ֤רֶת הַ⁠סַּמִּים֙	1	The expression **he shall give ... on** is an idiom that means to put **some of the blood** onto **the horns of the altar**. If your language has a similar idiom, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “And he shall put some of the blood onto the horns of the altar of incense of the spices”
4:7	rrcr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	קַ֠רְנוֹת מִזְבַּ֨ח קְטֹ֤רֶת הַ⁠סַּמִּים֙	1	The **horns of the altar** refer to the four projections at the corners of the **altar**. They are shaped like the **horns** of an ox. Alternate translation: “the horn-shaped projections at the corners of the altar of incense of the spices”
4:7	n7r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִזְבַּ֨ח קְטֹ֤רֶת הַ⁠סַּמִּים֙	1	The **altar of incense of the spices** refers to the place where priests burned fragrance incense twice a day, located directly in front of the curtain which separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of the tent of meeting. It is described in detail in [Exodus 30:1–10](exod/30/01.md). Alternate translation: “the altar of the fragrant incenses”
4:7	hgoz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1	Because this verse specifies that the incense altar is located inside the **tent of meeting**, here the expression **to the face of Yahweh** means directly in front of the Holy of Holies, the location where Yahweh was enthroned above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant. Alternate translation: “in the sacred vicinity of the tent of meeting where Yahweh ” or “directly in front of Yahweh’s presence in the Holy of Holies”
4:7	w9my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אֵ֣ת ׀ כָּל־דַּ֣ם הַ⁠פָּ֗ר	1	Given that the priest has just sprinkled some of **the blood** and dripped some of the blood on **the horns of the altar**, the phrase **all the blood of the bull** refers to the blood that remains after these first two applications. If this would be unclear in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “And any remaining blood of the bull”
4:8	opbk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָרִ֣ים מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **he** here refers to the anointed priest because he is both the one offering the sacrifice and the one performing the sacrificial rite. If this is unclear in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “the anointed priest shall lift up from it”
4:8	rd3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	 יָרִ֣ים מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The expression **he shall lift up** is an idiom that means to carefully remove and set aside. If it would be helpful in your language, consider using a word or phrase that expresses the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he shall trim from it and set aside”

4:9	li4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 יְסִירֶֽ⁠נָּה׃	1	As in [3:4](../03/04.md), [3:10](../03/10.md), and [3:15](../03/15.md), the one who removes the fat from the sacrificial animal is the worshiper, not the priest. However, because here the anointed priest is both the one offering the sacrifice and the one performing the sacrifice, the pronoun **he** refers to the priest. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “the anointed priest shall remove it”
4:10	dy4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר יוּרַ֔ם מִ⁠שּׁ֖וֹר זֶ֣בַח הַ⁠שְּׁלָמִ֑ים	1	Here, **it** refers to all the fat that was described in the instructions about peace offerings in [3:3–4](../03/03.md). If it would be helpful, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “just as the fat is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offering”
4:10	xvzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר יוּרַ֔ם מִ⁠שּׁ֖וֹר זֶ֣בַח הַ⁠שְּׁלָמִ֑ים	1	Here, the author of Leviticus does not use the present tense to describe contemporaneous or ongoing action, as if he is here referring to a specific instance where an individual is preparing a peace offering. Rather, the present tense is being used both to describe an action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation. If it would be helpful in your language, consider choosing language that makes it plain that the author is not referring to specific past actions. Alternate translation: “in the same manner as it would be removed from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offering”
4:10	cded		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר יוּרַ֔ם	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “just as people remove the fat”If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “just as the individual removed the fat” or, if you used the second-person form in chapter 3, “just as you removed the fat”
4:10	peg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הִקְטִירָ⁠ם֙ הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֔ן	1	The pronoun **them** refers to all the pieces of fat and the internal organs described in [4:8–9](../04/08.md).

If this would be unclear, consider using a phrase to indicate that this list introduces the subject of the verse, which will be restated in [4:12](../04/12.md). Alternate translation: “As for the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and with its legs and its innards and its dung”
4:11	ovny			וְ⁠אֶת־כָּל־בְּשָׂר֔⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “all of the bull’s meat”
4:12	xwxo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 וְ⁠הוֹצִ֣יא	1	The pronoun **he** cannot refer to the priest making the sacrifice, because this action would cause the priest to become impure.

Rather, the present tense is being used both to describe an action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation. If it would be helpful in your language, consider choosing language that makes it plain that the author is not referring to specific past actions. Alternate translation: “in the same manner as the fat of the lamb would be removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings”

5:1	rx2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	 וְ⁠נֶ֣פֶשׁ כִּֽי־תֶחֱטָ֗א וְ⁠שָֽׁמְעָה֙	1	Although the words translated **a person** is feminine, it has a generic sense that refers to any person who approaches the tent to make a sacrifice. If your language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. See how you handled the similar phrase in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “And when any person sins, and he hears” or “And when someone sins, and he hears”
5:1	a833		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֣וֹל אָלָ֔ה	1	The **sound of a curse** is an idiom that refers to someone hearing a publicly spoken imprecatory curse against the perpetrator of a crime which has harmed the individual who speaks the curse (see the parallel text in [Proverbs 29:24](prov/29/24.md)). The implication of this verse is that if the individual who hears the curse against the perpetrator of the crime fails to testify against that individual in the context of the judicial system, then he must **carry his iniquity** (for this phrase, see the next note). Alternate translation: “someone pronouncing a curse against someone who has wronged them”
5:1	erm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נָשָׂ֥א עֲוֺנֽ⁠וֹ	1	The expression **he shall carry his iniquity** refers to being responsible to make restitution for the guilt acquired by an individual’s wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional.

If your language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. See how you handled the similar phrase in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “when any person touches” or “when someone touches”
5:2	ix6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	טָמֵא֒ & טְמֵאָ֗ה & טְמֵאָ֔ה & טָמֵ֑א & טָמֵ֖א	1	For an object or body to be **unclean** means that it has acquired impurity through its perceived proximity to death. In ancient Israel, this impurity was seen to pollute the holy space where Yahweh lived among the Israelites and could desecrate the sacred items that were consecrated to him. Consequently, anything impure or unclean was not allowed to enter the sacred space or touch anything clean or holy. If your language has a similar word, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic term. Alternate translation: “polluted … polluted … polluted … polluted … is polluted himself”
5:2	kw6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְ⁠נִבְלַ֨ת חַיָּ֜ה טְמֵאָ֗ה	1	The expression **the unclean carcass of an animal** does not refer to the body of a specific animal. Rather, it describes the carcass of any wild animal that an Israelite might encounter. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the dead body of any wild animal”
5:2	gh1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְּ⁠נִבְלַת֙ בְּהֵמָ֣ה טְמֵאָ֔ה	1	The expression **the unclean carcass of livestock** does not refer to a the body of a specific animal. Rather, it describes the carcass of any domesticated animal that an Israelite might own. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the unclean dead body of any of a person's domesticated animals”
5:2	tkk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	 בְּ⁠נִבְלַ֖ת שֶׁ֣רֶץ טָמֵ֑א	1	The expression **the carcass of an unclean swarming animal** does not refer to a specific animal. Rather, it describes the carcass of any animal or insect that swarms or creeps on the ground, including winged, swarming insects, mice, rats, and lizards (see [11:20–23](../11/20.md) and [11:24–29](../11/24.md) for the full list of these animals). Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the dead body of any impure animal that creeps or swarms on the ground”
5:2	kf5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 וְ⁠נֶעְלַ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and he does not realize that he touched something unclean”
5:2	a2xy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אָשֵֽׁם	1	Here, to become **guilty** means both to feel the internal sense of having done wrong and to enter into a legal state of needing to make reparations for wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional. As the General Introduction to the chapter discusses, this kind of guilt resulted in the need for the **guilt offering**, by which a person atoned for himself and made reparation for the impurity that he brought into the sacred space by his wrongdoing. Alternate translation: “and he needs to make reparations for his wrongdoing”
5:3	kp8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	 א֣וֹ כִ֤י יִגַּע֙ בְּ⁠טֻמְאַ֣ת אָדָ֔ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uncleanness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Or if he touches a human body in a way that makes pollutes him”
5:3	dmsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠טֻמְאַ֣ת אָדָ֔ם	1	The expression **the uncleanness of a man** uses the possessive form to refer to the uncleanness that is acquired from a human source. Alternate translation: “the uncleanness that comes from a person”
5:3	fuj0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִטְמָ֖א בָּ֑⁠הּ	1	Here, a verb and its object come from the same root. The phrase **he becomes unclean** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated **uncleanness**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. 
5:3	ymu7			לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִטְמָ֖א בָּ֑⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: “with regard to all of a person's sins by which he sins”
5:3	twrx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to the **man** mentioned earlier in the verse, which, although masculine, has a generic sense that refers to any human being, whether living or dead.

Alternate translation: “and he does not realize it” or “and he does not know about it”
5:3	i368			וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָדַ֖ע	1	Alternate translation: “when he himself knows”
5:3	rvsc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָדַ֖ע	1	The reflexive pronoun **himself** emphasizes how significant it is that **the man**, who had previously been unaware of having touched any uncleanness, had come to realize what he had done. Consider using a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “but only when he alone knows”
5:3	jy32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָדַ֖ע	1	The expression **but he himself knows** is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but when he himself knows that he has unintentionally touched something unclean”

It implies that after the person **swears** the oath, he either cannot fulfill it or he does not really want to fulfill it. If this would not be clear in your language, consider stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a person hastily swears an oath with two lips without the intention to do what he promised, to do evil or to do good”

Alternate translation: “with regard to everything that a person speaks rashly in an oath”

5:6	x2i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֵבִ֣יא אֶת־אֲשָׁמ֣⁠וֹ לַ⁠יהוָ֡ה	1	Here, **his guilt** does not refer to the legal status of guilt that it did in [5:2–5](../05/02.md). Rather, it refers to the required penalty for that person’s guilt, that is, the animal sacrifice that will provide atonement for the individual’s guilt that he acquired by sinning unintentionally. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “And he shall bring the required sacrifice required by Yahweh”
5:6	twdf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠הֵבִ֣יא אֶת־אֲשָׁמ֣⁠וֹ לַ⁠יהוָ֡ה	1	Here, to **bring** the required sacrifice **to Yahweh** refers to carrying the sacrifice to the altar that is located at the entrance of the tent of meeting, as described with the other sacrificial processes in the previous chapters. Because the tent of meeting was where Yahweh lived among the Israelites, taking the offering to the altar is considered the same as bringing it directly to Yahweh himself. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “And he shall bring his guilt to the altar that is located inside the tent of meeting, where Yahweh lives among the Israelites”

If your language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. See how you handled the similar phrase in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “When any person trespasses” or “When someone trespasses”
5:15	sst7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	תִמְעֹ֣ל מַ֔עַל	1	Here, a verb and its object come from the same root.

Because the tent of meeting was where Yahweh lived among the Israelites, taking the offering to the altar is considered the same as bringing it directly to Yahweh himself. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “then he shall bring his guilt to the altar that is located inside the tent of meeting, where Yahweh lives among the Israelites”

You could try to express this amount in terms of the current monetary value of silver, but that might cause your translation to become outdated and inaccurate since those values can change over time. Instead, consider using a generic phrase. Alternate translation: “in your valuation, the standard weight of silver that is used by the priests in the holy place”
5:15	rptx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠קֹּ֖דֶשׁ	1	The **holy place** is another way of saying the precincts of the sacred tent where Yahweh lived among the Israelites.

5:15	ozia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לְ⁠אָשָֽׁם	1	As the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, the **guilt offering** was a special kind of sacrifice that made restitution for the desecrated object that was was mishandled by the individual who sinned unintentionally with regard to the sacred objects consecrated to Yahweh.
5:16	gao6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁר֩ חָטָ֨א מִן־הַ⁠קֹּ֜דֶשׁ יְשַׁלֵּ֗ם	1	The expression **he shall restore** does not mean that the guilty individual must physically replace the desecrated object in the sacred tent. Rather, the expression refers to the process of bringing the monetary value of the object in silver (in addition to one-fifth of its value) to the priest as part of the sacrifice. Be sure that this distinction is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “And he shall make restitution for that which he which he sinned”
5:16	rlc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁר֩ חָטָ֨א	1	The expression **that which he sinned** refers to the specific sacred object that the person desecrated by mishandling it according to the commandments of Yahweh regarding the proper treatment of sacred objects.

Rather, these expressions refer to the item’s monetary value. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “and a fifth of the value of the sacred object he shall add to the value of that object”
5:16	g15p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction	חֲמִֽישִׁת⁠וֹ֙	1	The **fifth** is one part out of five equal parts.

If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.

5:18	w9fo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠ה֥וּא לֹֽא־יָדַ֖ע	1	This phrase is a parenthetical aside that functions to provide essential background information for the current thought.

Alternate translation: “but he was unaware”
5:18	irws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠ה֥וּא לֹֽא־יָדַ֖ע	1	This expression uses the reflexive pronoun **himself** to emphasize how significant it was that the person who previously was unaware of their unintentional sin has now come to realize what they had done.

5:18	xtjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠ה֥וּא לֹֽא־יָדַ֖ע	1	This expression leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:2	hezk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כִחֵ֨שׁ בַּ⁠עֲמִית֜⁠וֹ	1	As the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, in the context of [6:2–3](../06/02.md), the expression **denies his fellow citizen** is an idiom that refers to the actions whereby someone swears a socially-binding oath with a member of their family or clan and commits himself or herself to certain actions regarding the other person, but afterward fails to behave in accordance with the stipulations of the oath. This could be done by stealing from the other individual, extorting them out of wages or any owed money, finding something that belongs to the other individual but failing to return it, or any other way of proving that the original oath was taken without intent to abide by it honestly. If the idiom here does not communicate this meaning in your language, consider using a more general expression. Alternate translation: “and he acts in such a way that breaks an oath that he made with his fellow citizen”
6:2	jfwm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠עֲמִית֜⁠וֹ	1	Here, a **fellow citizen** does not refer to “citizens” in a modern sense.

If the term **citizen** would be misleading in your language, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “a member of his immediate or extended family or clan”
6:2	k1zm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠פִקָּד֗וֹן	1	This **deposit** refers to either (1) a monetary down payment that served to guarantee the full payment of a larger amount.

Alternate translation: “with an item given to him for safekeeping”
6:2	vren		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֽוֹ־בִ⁠תְשׂ֤וּמֶת יָד֙	1	The expression **a pledge of a hand** refers to a physical item that is given from one member of a community to another.

6:2	d182		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	א֖וֹ עָשַׁ֥ק אֶת־עֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, to **extort** a **fellow citizen** refers to an employer refusing to pay an employee his or her wages or one member of a party willfully withholding a previously agreed-upon amount of money from the other.

6:3	zsj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִשְׁבַּ֣ע	1	The expression **he swears** does not refer to the use of profanity or taboo language.

6:21	u6mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	תְּבִיאֶ֑⁠נָּה & תַּקְרִ֥יב	1	As the General Introduction to the book of Leviticus discusses, the book often speaks of the Israelites and to the Israelites in the third person, even in a direct address. However, as the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, here and throughout the rest of the chapter, the author of Leviticus switches to a second-person address. If you have been using third-person pronouns since chapter 4, and the sudden switch to second-person pronouns would be confusing in your language, consider continuing to use the third-person in your translation. Alternate translation: “he shall bring it … he shall present”

If this would be unclear in your language, consider making the implied information explicit.

7:7	ftun		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל֥⁠וֹ יִהְיֶֽה	1	The expression **it will be for him** means that the portion of the animal (in context, the skin of the peace offering, along with the breast meat and the right thigh) belongs to the priest as his allotment from Yahweh. It is questionable whether the skin serves as a food source for the priests, as the other portions do. Rather, it seems likely that the skin would be used for other, unspecified uses.

7:18	em1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֧א יֵחָשֵׁ֛ב ל֖⁠וֹ	1	Here, the forgiveness brought about by the sacrifice is spoken of using legal or possibly financial terminology, as if the sacrifice would be accredited to a person’s account before Yahweh. If your language uses similar metaphors to convey these ideas, consider using them here. If not, consider using a general expression. Alternate translation: “the person who offers the sacrifice will not be forgiven”
7:18	w5e2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פִּגּ֣וּל	1	For the meat of a sacrifice to be **defiled** means that it has remained uneaten for an unacceptably long time such that it is now no longer acceptable to Yahweh.

If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternative translation: “spoiled and unacceptable meat”

Alternate expression: “But, as for clean meat that has not touched any unclean thing”
7:19	cj9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־טָה֖וֹר	1	The expression **any clean person** refers to any individual who has succeeded in remaining ceremonially clean by abstaining from touching anything that would render him unclean, as instructed by Leviticus.

7:19	ls5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 בָּשָֽׂר	1	The **meat** referred to here is the same as **the meat** that has not touched anything unclean and so is considered clean. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “any clean meat”

However, as stated before, Yahweh does not eat, nor does he need food from human beings. The peace offerings belong to Yahweh in the sense that they are dedicated especially to Yahweh’s special purposes. Consequently, the portions of meat from these sacrifices are not to be used for any common purpose. In your translation, make sure that it is not implied that the meat from these sacrifices provides Yahweh with food.

This could be: (1) an idiom that refers to Yahweh’s executing divine judgment against the individual in some unspecified manner, thus removing the person from the people of God. Alternate translation: “then that person will be punished and removed from her people” or, to avoid the passive form, “then Yahweh will execute divine judgment against that person and remove her from her people” or (2) a metaphor that refers to the people excommunicating the individual from her community. Alternative translation: “then that person should be removed from her people and excommunicated” or, to avoid the passive form, “then the people should remove that person from the people and refuse to have contact with her”

These included the mole rat, the mouse, and several kinds of lizard. If your language has a specific term for the kind of animal that is considered taboo to touch or to eat, consider using it here.

If the switch from third-person to second-person forms would be confusing in your language, consider continuing to use whichever form you have been using for the previous chapters. Alternate translation: “No one should eat” 
7:23	z2p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ	1	Here, **You** is plural. It refers to the people of Israel who would offer sacrifices at the tent of meeting.

7:24	vs7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	יֵעָשֶׂ֖ה לְ⁠כָל־מְלָאכָ֑ה	1	The expression **will be made for any work** uses a future statement to denote permission or allowance.

If this would not be clear in your language, consider stating the meaning plainly.

7:24	e2ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	וְ⁠אָכֹ֖ל לֹ֥א תֹאכְלֻֽ⁠הוּ	1	Here the expression **eating, you shall not eat it** uses a repetition of the verbal form in order to intensify the idea that the eating of these fat portions is forbidden. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “but you should certainly never eat it” or, using the third-person, “but no one should ever eat it”

Although the reason for the choice of the **right** portion of the thighs is unknown and debated, the **thigh** itself was considered a uniquely choice portion of meat, and so was especially dedicated to Yahweh and to his special purposes, like providing food for the priests. If your language has a word for this choice portion of an animal’s meat, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression.

Because the Levites, the sons of Aaron, were not given any portion of land and therefore could not farm for themselves, they were dependent on the contributions of their fellow Israelites for food. Yahweh provided this food by setting apart these choice portions for the priests. If this would not be clear from your translation, consider stating the meaning plainly.

Further research may be needed to determine the exact location of different parts of an animal. Many of these foods are not consumed to this day because they cause diseases, but it is unclear why the other foods are prohibited.\n\nEating unclean foods made a person unclean.

Essentially, the animal must both chew **the cud** and have a completely divided **hoof**. The implication, as the following verses will illustrate, is that if an animal fulfills only one of these criteria, it should be considered unclean. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation.

If your language has a general word for this digestive process, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “that eats partially digested food”
11:3	le05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	גֵּרָ֖ה	1	Here, **the cud** does not refer to a specific food substance. Rather, it refers to any food that an animal chews again. This may be food that returns from the first stomach of certain animals to their mouth for further chewing, as with camels, or food that is digested, passed, and eaten again, as with rabbits and rock badgers.

For example, an animal may chew cud (like **the camel** in the current verse), but it may not have a completely divided hoof (or any hoof at all). Alternatively, the animal may possess a divided hoof but not chew any cud. These types of animals were to be considered unclean. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation.

Rather, the designation refers to whether or not the animal should be considered acceptable for an Israelite to eat and whether contact with the animal would ritually defile the people of Israel. By maintaining a specific diet, the people of Israel would keep themselves separated and distinct from the people and nations around them, demonstrating that they are holy people, dedicated to Yahweh (as [11:43–45](../11/43.md) explains). In your translation, be sure to indicate the label **unclean** does not refer to an animal being unhygienic or unhealthy.

This was important because these diseases could have easily spread among the people in the ancient Near East. This is also true concerning things growing on clothing or things that touch a person’s skin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])

14:intro	u79h				0	# Leviticus 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of the material in the previous chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Skin disease and mildew\n\nThis chapter addresses the ways a priest was to decide if a person had a skin disease, which would make a person unclean. This was important because these diseases could have easily spread among the people in the ancient Near East. This was also true for the things which could have touched a person’s skin. This chapter explains how the priest was to treat the person suffering with a skin disease. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])
14:1	plba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר	1	The word translated **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, consider ways in which you might introduce this quotation naturally in your language.

14:2	xvvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 הַ⁠מְּצֹרָ֔ע	1	This expression refers to any person who has had a **skin disease** that was described in the previous chapter but has now been pronounced clean. The following instructions pertain to the sacrifices that such an individual requires in order to receive atonement and be cleansed from the impurity that they acquired from their previous skin condition. It may be helpful to clarify this meaning for your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “any person who had a skin disease but was pronounced clean by the priest”

14:4	ws3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠אֵזֹֽב	1	This **hyssop** was a herby, leafed plant that was common in Israel.

If your language has a specific word for a pot made from this material, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “a clay vessel”
14:5	h3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֶ֖רֶשׂ	1	The **container** is described as made of **clay**, which refers to a material similar to earthenware or potsherds, out of which a pot-shaped vessel could be shaped and baked in a kiln until hardened.

This action ritually purifies and cleanses the individual from any impurity that they acquired through their unclean **skin disease**. It may be helpful to explain this to your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation. See how you handled the idea of ritual sprinkling in [1:5](../01/05.md) and elsewhere.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he shall shave all his hair, including his head and his beard and the brows of his eyes and all his hair”

Rather, the present tense is being used both to describe an action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation.

Any other sacrifice was strictly prohibited. This was probably intended to ensure that the people were only offering sacrifices to Yahweh and not to another god. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The life of each creature is its blood”\n\nIt is unclear why the life is described as being in the blood. It is possible that diseases were more common in the blood and this is why it was prohibited. Blood is also necessary for life to continue in a creature. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])
