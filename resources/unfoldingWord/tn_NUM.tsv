While traveling, the Israelites became discouraged. So they rebelled against the leaders whom God had given them. At the Jordan River, the people of Israel refused to enter the Promised Land. Because the Israelites were afraid and did not trust God, he delayed their entry into the Promised Land for forty years (13:1–14:45). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe title of this book, “Numbers,” refers to when the number of the Israelites was counted. The people of the project language may already be familiar with the name “Numbers” from other Bible versions. If not, the translator could consider a clearer name for the book, such as “The Counting of the People of Israel.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/census]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Numbers?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the Book of Numbers. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How does Numbers present the idea of the whole community being responsible when only a few people sinned?\n\nThe people understood and assumed that God would punish the whole community of Israel if some of the people rebelled against him. God did often punish the entire nation when some of them sinned. All of the people in the ancient Near East would have understood and expected this. However, Moses and Aaron prayed for God to punish only those who were guilty.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Why does Moses speak using third person pronouns about himself?\n\nWhen an author wrote about something he was involved in, it was common for him to use the pronoun “he” instead of “I,” or “they” instead of “we.” The translator may decide to use the project’s normal pronouns instead. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “Shall” and “Shall not”\n\nIn this book, “shall” is used to give a command and “shall not” is used to give a prohibition. While the form itself is not a command or prohibition, it can be interpreted and translated as such. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words using a command or instruction form. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])\n\n### Sons of Israel and Israel\n\nThroughout this book, “sons of Israel” and “Israel” usually refer to the Israelite nation or people group as if all of them were the sons of their ancestor Israel, who is also called Jacob. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” or “the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])
1:intro	av14				0	# Numbers 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Preparing to leave Sinai (1:1–10:10)\n    * Counting and assembling the tribes (1:1–4:49)\n\nThis chapter is intended to form a smooth transition from the last chapter of the book of Leviticus. It describes the counting of Israelite men who are able to fight in the army.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Census\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh commands Moses and Aaron to count how many men of military age were in each tribe of Israel. Some of these men were also called to lead their family groups.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “A son of 20 years and upward” \n\nThis phrase refers to a man who is at least 20 years old. It might be helpful in your language to state this more plainly. Alternate translation: “a man who is at least 20 years old” or “a man who is 20 years or older” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “One who goes out to war”\n\nThis phrase refers to a soldier by describing the action that characterizes a soldier. If your readers would not understand what this concept means in this context, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “one who can be a soldier” or “one who can fight in a war”
1:1	nore		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠אֶחָד֩	1	Moses uses **one** to imply day **one of the second month**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “on day one”

If your language has a word for this kind of landscape, consider using it here. If not, consider using a general expression. Alternate translation: “in the dry, desert plain of Sinai”
1:1	qchv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠אֶחָד֩	1	Here Moses is using a cardinal number, **one**, to mean “first.” If your language does not use cardinal numbers, you can also use a ordinal number here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on the first”\n
1:1	u2p1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	לַ⁠חֹ֨דֶשׁ הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֜י	1	The **second month** of the Hebrew calendar includes the last half of April and the first half of May on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, which is “Iyar” here, then say in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.
1:1	owqr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	לַ⁠חֹ֨דֶשׁ הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֜י בַּ⁠שָּׁנָ֣ה הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֗ית	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “of month two in year two”

1:4	cx5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וְ⁠אִתְּ⁠כֶ֣ם	1	Here Yahweh uses **you** to refer to two men, Moses and Aaron, so **you** would be dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, the word would be plural.

3:intro	d7r1				0	# Numbers 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Preparing to leave Sinai (1:1–10:10)\n    * Counting and assembling the tribes (1:1–4:49)\n\nThis chapter describes the counting of Levite men and their assignments for taking care of the tent of meeting.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The tribe of Levi\n\nThe Levites had a special role in Israel. They were specially dedicated to serve Yahweh by offering sacrifices in the tent of meeting and taking care of that tent and everything involved in the system of sacrifices. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n\n### Ransom\n\nIn [3:45](../03/45.md)–[51](../03/51.md), Yahweh requires the Israelites to pay a ransom to him for the firstborn males that he did not kill during the tenth plague in Egypt, as described in [Exodus 12:29](../exo/12/29.md) and [13:15](../exo/13/15.md). Because Yahweh did not kill the firstborn male people and animals among the Israelites, he considered them to owe him their lives. Instead of taking their lives, Yahweh chose the Levite men to be his special servants in their place. However, the number of Levites was 273 people less than the number of firstborn males, so Yahweh required the people to pay money to him to redeem those additional people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/ransom]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]])

Preparing to leave Sinai (1:1–10:10)\n    * Counting and assembling the tribes (1:1–4:49)\n\nThis chapter describes the assignments Yahweh gave to each of the families who descended from Levi with regard for taking care of and transporting the tent of meeting. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The tribe of Levi\n\nThe Levites had a special role in Israel. They were specially dedicated to serve Yahweh by offering sacrifices in the tent of meeting and taking care of that tent and everything involved in the system of sacrifices. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “A son of 30 years and upward and up to a son of 50 years”\n\nThe phrase “a son of … years” is an idiom that refers to the age of a man. The longer phrase here refers to a man who is at least 30 years old and at most 50 years old. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a man who is at least 30 years old and at most 50 years old” or “a man who is between 30 years or and 50 years old” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n

15:intro	s9dr				0	# Numbers 15 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Purifying the people\n\nAs the people travel through the wilderness, Yahweh is purifying them. He is doing this so that they are able to enter into the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/purify]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Prostitution\n\nThe imagery of prostitution is commonly used in Scripture to indicate that Yahweh alone is to be worshiped. The people are compared to the prostitute because a husband is to only have a sexual relationship with his wife. Both the prostitute and the worship of other gods are violations of this exclusive relationship. Many cultures will struggle with this imagery because of a desire to use euphemisms.

So Moses told them to come to the sacred tent and burn incense to Yahweh. God then made the earth open and swallow up these leaders and their families. He also sent fire to destroy 250 other men who had joined with those leaders. These actions showed that only the Levites, those whom Yahweh appointed, could be priests. Also, it taught the people that to rebel against Yahweh’s anointed was to rebel against Yahweh.
