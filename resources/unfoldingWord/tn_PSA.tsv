front:intro	rx9u				0	# Introduction to Psalms\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Psalms\n\n1. Book One (Psalms 1–41)\n1. Book Two (Psalms 42–72)\n1. Book Three (Psalms 73–89)\n1. Book Four (Psalms 90–106)\n1. Book Five (Psalms 107–150)\n\n### What is the book of Psalms?\n\nThe book of Psalms is a collection of songs. People called psalmists wrote them for different reasons. In some psalms, the psalmists expressed their praise for God. In other psalms, they asked God for help and expressed confidence in his love and power. In others, they confessed their sins and begged for mercy. The Israelites wrote some psalms to ask Yahweh to defeat their enemies. Other psalms celebrated the event of a new king beginning his reign. Psalmists also wrote to praise the city of Jerusalem. They wrote some psalms to instruct people on how to be wise by honoring Yahweh and obeying his law. Also, pilgrims sang some of the psalms while traveling to Jerusalem to worship there. Some psalms became songs of praise in the temple worship of Yahweh.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title of this book, “The Book of Psalms” or just “Psalms.” Another title of this book is “Songs of Praise.” Translators may express this meaning in their own languages, or they may choose to use or transliterate the name from another language version if it is well known. For example, the French title “Les Psaumes” might be understood by everyone in a project language, if French is the language of wider communication in the region. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### When was the book of Psalms written?\n\nThe psalms were written over a long period of time. Moses probably wrote the earliest psalm around 1400 B.C. David and Asaph wrote their psalms between 1020 and 975 B.C. The Korahites may have written their psalms before Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jews were exiled to Babylon in 587 B.C. Psalm 126 appears to come from the period after the exile, which ended in 538 B.C.\n\n### What are the Messianic psalms?\n\nSome psalms are called “Messianic psalms.” New Testament writers considered these psalms to prophesy about the Messiah, Jesus Christ. They cited Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 34, 40, 41, 45, 68, 69, 89, 102, 109, 110, and 118 at least one time each in the New Testament.\n\n### What are superscriptions in the Psalms?\n\nMany psalms give some information called superscriptions before the beginning of the psalm. Some of the expressions in the superscriptions are difficult to understand, so modern versions often have different interpretations of them.\n\nSeventy-three psalms are called “A psalm of David.” This may mean they were written by King David. Or, it could mean someone wrote them for David or in the style that David used when he composed poetry. The superscriptions of some psalms give the historical situations in which they were written.\n\nSome superscriptions give instructions about how they should be played and sung. They tell which instruments, singers, or melodies should be used for that psalm. Fifty-five psalms are addressed “to the choirmaster” or “chief musician.” The psalmists seem to have meant them to be used in temple worship.\n\nTraditionally, English versions do not give verse numbers to the superscriptions. But many versions in other languages do. Whether or not translators give them verse numbers, they should consider the superscriptions in the Psalms as part of the divinely inspired biblical text.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What are some important ways in which Yahweh is pictured in the book of Psalms?\n\nThe psalmists often pictured Yahweh as:\n\n* a king who rules over the nation of Israel and over all the nations\n* a shepherd who leads the people of Israel and also the individual psalm writers\n* a “rock,” that is, a high rocky mountain on which people can be completely safe from their enemies\n* a strong warrior who always defeats his enemies.\n\n### What is the importance of honor and shame in the book of Psalms?\n\nWhen people honor someone, they think well of him and may even admire him. On the other hand, if people shame someone, that person loses honor and is disgraced.\n\nPsalmists often expressed a great desire that Yahweh would be honored by the Israelites and also by the rest of the world.\n\nAlso, psalmists often expressed fear that they would be shamed by their enemies. When they felt this way, the psalmists wrote of their trust that Yahweh would not allow this to happen.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Why do the ULT and UST display the book of Psalms as poetry, but some modern versions do not?\n\nThe psalmists wrote the psalms as Hebrew poetry. The ULT and UST set each line farther to the right on the page than regular text is placed to show that the writing is poetry rather than prose.\n\nThis style typically uses pairs of poetic lines that relate to each other in different ways. Usually, poetic lines are said to be “parallel” to each other. A line that is indented farther to the right is paired with the line above it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\nTranslators will have to decide whether to present the psalms as poetry or as prose in their own language. Translators will need to consider whether their language has poetic forms that are suitable for expressing the psalms.\n\n### Why do some versions number the psalms differently than others?\n\nFrom ancient times, people have numbered the psalms in different ways. The Jews numbered the psalms in Hebrew in one way. When they translated the psalms into Greek, they numbered them in a different way. As a result, the Hebrew numbering and the Greek numbering of psalms were both passed down through the centuries. They are both still in use today. Translators will probably want to number the psalms in the same way that most versions in their own country do.\n\n### How should the translator view the terms Selah and Higgaion that occur in various psalms?\n\n“Selah” and “Higgaion” seem to be musical terms inserted as directions for singers and musicians. Scholars do not agree as to their meaning. For this reason, translators may decide to transliterate them or leave them out rather than try to translate them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
1:intro	fan4				0	# Psalm 1 General Notes\n\n## About the Psalm\n\nPsalm 1 is usually considered to be a “wisdom psalm,” which gives advice to those who hear it read or sung.\n\n**Purpose:** to celebrate the one who follows Yahweh's guidance\n\n**Content:** It is the one who delights in Yahweh's guidance who is “happy.” “All of this is because Yahweh cares for righteous people, but wicked people keep sinning until Yahweh destroys them forever.” (verse 6)\n\n**Message:** Devotion to Yahweh's guidance leads to success and honor.\n\n## Outline:\n\n- Verses 1–3 The happy: Those devoted to Yahweh’s instruction prosper.\n- Verses 4–5 The unhappy: Those who reject Yahweh’s instruction come to nothing.\n- Verses 6 Authority: Yahweh directs each path to its destination.\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n\n- Words associated (whether by sound or by meaning) with a journey appear throughout the psalm.\n- In Hebrew, in the word “wicked” the consonant sounds in “happy” are reversed.\n- Verses 1 and 5 have a number of correspondences with one another. There are negated clauses in both verses, and both contain motion verbs. Additionally, the phrase “advice of the wicked” in verse 1a is similar to the phrase ”assembly of the righteous” in verse 5b. The phrases also have similar structure. In Hebrew the words for “advice” and “assembly” sound very similar.\n\n## Figurative language (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]]):\n- The psalm begins and ends with the metaphor of a journey.\n- There is agricultural imagery which is frequent in scripture: a tree by water (representing flourishing through God’s blessing) and separating wheat from chaff (representing the different judgments of the righteous and wicked). \n\n### CCBYSA\n\nSignificant portions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 1](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_1) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
1:1	c8cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אַ֥שְֽׁרֵי	1	The **man** described as happy is someone that others admire and desire to be like. **Happy** here can be a congratulatory term. Alternate translation: “Admirable” or “Praised”
1:1	n9y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַ֥שְֽׁרֵי־הָ⁠אִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר ׀ לֹ֥א הָלַךְ֮ בַּ⁠עֲצַ֪ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים וּ⁠בְ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ חַ֭טָּאִים לֹ֥א עָמָ֑ד וּ⁠בְ⁠מוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב	1	In some languages it may be more natural to place the declaration of the state of the man at the end of the verse after the description of the characteristics that he avoids. However, starting the psalm with the exclamation **Happy** was an intentional poetic decision by the author, who intended to set the mood of the psalm. Translators should consider how their language might start the psalm with the same sort of praising exclamation. Alternate translation: “The man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked ones, and stands not in the pathway with sinners, and sits not in the seat of mockers is happy.”
1:1	a5wm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הָ⁠אִ֗ישׁ	1	The **man** here may refer first to the ideal Israelite king while also having a general meaning referring to a typical righteous person. If your readers would not understand **the man** in a general way, you may choose a term that gives a broader interpretation. One possible way to do this may be by not using a definite article. Alternate translation: “is a man” or “is the person” or “is a person”
1:1	x0do		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	לֹ֥א הָלַךְ֮ בַּ⁠עֲצַ֪ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים וּ⁠בְ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ חַ֭טָּאִים לֹ֥א עָמָ֑ד וּ⁠בְ⁠מוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב	1	It may be helpful to read these three phrases in an inverted way. That way the negative trajectory that the happy man avoids can be more clearly seen. Consider: “Unhappy is the man who walks in the advice of the wicked ones and then who stands in the pathway of sinners and then who sits in the seat of scoffers.” The meaning of each of these parts of this extended metaphor is expanded in later notes, but translators should see a trajectory of worsening character that a happy man avoids.
1:1	ma8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	לֹ֥א הָלַךְ֮ בַּ⁠עֲצַ֪ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים	1	Here, **walks** refers to a **man** doing the things that **wicked ones** suggest that he does. This is the beginning of a pattern of doing wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the image clear or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “does not walk into sin that wicked people suggest” or “never does what wicked people suggest”
1:1	y9ow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	וּ⁠בְ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ חַ֭טָּאִים לֹ֥א עָמָ֑ד	1	Here, **stands not in the pathway of sinners** refers to not copying how sinners continually live their lives, that is, their sinful habits. Standing means joining with sinners. The **pathway** means habits or how they live. Not only does the happy man not do what the wicked say, but doing what sinners do does not become the way in which he lives his life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the image clear or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and does not stand with sinners in the path of sinning” or “and does not make sinning a habit”
1:1	b9ef		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	וּ⁠בְ⁠מוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב	1	Here, **sits not in the seat of scoffers** means to not become like people who spend their time mocking people, things, and God. By avoiding the previous two progressions towards a sinful life, the happy man avoids this final state where he would be just like the wicked. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the image clear or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and does not sit with scoffers to join them in scoffing” or “so he never becomes like wicked mockers”
1:2	x7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּ֤י אִ֥ם	1	The author uses the word **But** here to indicate a strong contrast between what the happy man does and does not do. In your translation, indicate this strong contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Rather,”
1:2	bvfv			בְּ⁠תוֹרַ֥ת & וּֽ⁠בְ⁠תוֹרָת֥⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “in the instruction of … and in his instruction”
1:2	zvgc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֶ֫פְצ֥⁠וֹ & יֶהְגֶּ֗ה	1	Here, **his** and **he** refer to the happy man.
1:2	fhfk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	חֶ֫פְצ֥⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **delight**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he delights” or “he rejoices”
1:2	nbop		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וּֽ⁠בְ⁠תוֹרָת֥⁠וֹ	1	Here, **his** refers to Yahweh. Alternate translation: “and in Yahweh’s instruction”
1:2	u4ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יוֹמָ֥ם וָ⁠לָֽיְלָה	1	Here, **day and night** is referring to all the time by naming major time components. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “round-the-clock” or “all the time”
1:3	q40p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְֽ⁠הָיָ֗ה כְּ⁠עֵץ֮ שָׁת֪וּל עַֽל־פַּלְגֵ֫י מָ֥יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר פִּרְי֨⁠וֹ ׀ יִתֵּ֬ן בְּ⁠עִתּ֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠עָלֵ֥⁠הוּ לֹֽא־יִבּ֑וֹל וְ⁠כֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה יַצְלִֽיחַ	1	The point of this verse’s comparison between the happy man and a well-watered tree is that just like the streams of water cause the tree to flourish, learning Yahweh’s instructions causes the man to flourish. (In Hebrew the phrases even sound similar.) Both a positive and negative comparison are given to strengthen the force of the point. The tree, fruit, and leaf references connect both back to Eden and forward to the end of Revelation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the argument a little more explicit as the “Like … so” connection does in the UST. See [92:12-92:14](../92/12.md) for another use of this imagery.
1:3	ovv7			שָׁת֪וּל	1	The point of the choice of the word **transplanted** is to emphasize the intentional placement of a tree so that it gets abundant water. Translators could use a word meaning “planted” if their readers would understand that this was intentional. Alternate translation: “deliberately planted” or “cultivated”
1:3	bet7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שָׁת֪וּל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that someone transplanted”
1:3	j6o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עָלֵ֥⁠הוּ לֹֽא־יִבּ֑וֹל	1	The author is referring figuratively to the tree dying by association with the way the leaves on a tree **wither** when a tree is dead or dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and it will not die”
1:3	s609		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וְ⁠עָלֵ֥⁠הוּ לֹֽא־יִבּ֑וֹל	1	Here the author uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “and its leaves are strong and green”
1:3	zo3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠כֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה יַצְלִֽיחַ	1	Here, both instances of **he** refer to the happy man.
1:4	s4jq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	לֹא־כֵ֥ן	1	The **so** here refers to everything in the first three verses. The **wicked** are not in any way like the happy man. If your language has a way to indicate that **so** refers back not just to the last line about success but to the wider context of the first three verses, consider using it.
1:4	as72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כַּ֝⁠מֹּ֗ץ	1	The word **chaff** refers to the parts of a wheat or other grain plant that are not food. The husk that surrounds the edible seed is very light, and it blows away when the wheat is threshed to separate out the edible seed. The stalks are collected and burned. Thus the chaff is with the grain until harvest but then separated and burned or blown away. If your readers would not be familiar with this process, you could describe the chaff or use another light and worthless material to describe the wicked. Alternate translation: “like dried seed husks” or “like fallen leaves”
1:4	evr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֥י אִם־כַּ֝⁠מֹּ֗ץ אֲֽשֶׁר־תִּדְּפֶ֥⁠נּוּ רֽוּחַ	1	The idea of **the wicked** as waste material gathered at the harvest and eliminated in some way is a common biblical image of God judging the wicked. If it would be helpful in your language, consider how to make the connection to the next verse show this more clearly, because there the author makes this explicit.
1:5	xo05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	עַל־כֵּ֤ן	1	**Thus** indicates that the connection between the previous statements and this is one of similarity. Just like the chaff is removed from the good harvest and destroyed, thus the wicked will be removed from Yahweh’s righteous people and destroyed. Use a natural form in your language for connecting this statement to the previous one. Alternate translation: “In the same way”
1:5	kt0k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־יָקֻ֣מוּ רְ֭שָׁעִים בַּ⁠מִּשְׁפָּ֑ט	1	To **stand in the judgment** is to be innocent. Unlike the man in [24:3-4](../24/03.md), the wicked will be judged by Yahweh and will not rise again as in [PSA 140:10](../140/10.md). If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the wicked ones will not get off the hook” or “the wicked ones will not be found innocent”
1:5	h9cj			יָקֻ֣מוּ	1	The word translated **stand** here is translated as “arise” in [140:10](../140/10.md) and in many other places. This hints at resurrection imagery, which helps to clarify which judgment is in the mind of the author.
1:5	dhfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠מִּשְׁפָּ֑ט	1	This refers to the time when Yahweh will finally judge the whole world. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in Yahweh’s final court”
1:5	yb22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ֝⁠חַטָּאִ֗ים	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “nor will sinners stand”
1:6	c4kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי	1	**For** here introduces an explanation of the contrast throughout this psalm. If possible, use a connector here that can refer back to more than just the immediate context.
1:6	pyo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יוֹדֵ֣עַ	1	Here, **knows** refers to Yahweh’s intimate and active involvement in the life of the righteous. Alternate translation: “guards”
1:6	lb7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	דֶּ֣רֶךְ צַדִּיקִ֑ים וְ⁠דֶ֖רֶךְ רְשָׁעִ֣ים תֹּאבֵֽד	1	Here, the author continues speaking of life as if it were a **way**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the lifestyle of the righteous, but the lifestyle of the wicked ones causes them to perish”
2:intro	z14u				0	# Psalm 2 General Notes\n\n## Type of psalm\n\nPsalm 2 is usually considered a royal psalm because it is about the king. It was probably first sung when a new person became the king. While there are (from the perspective of the New Testament) clear references to Jesus, the Anointed (Messiah) Son of God (Yahweh), translators should avoid bringing this fuller understanding into the translation of this psalm, which was written around 1,000 years before Christ.\n\n\n## Structure\n\n1. verses 1–3 Rebellion - Earthly kings plot rebellion\n2. verses 4–6 Response - The Heavenly King laughs\n3. verses 7–9 Decree - The King on Zion recounts Yahweh's covenant\n4. verses 10–12 Ultimatum - Earthly kings, “Serve Yahweh … Kiss the son!”\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n\n- The place of reference moves between things being on earth (verse 2), in heaven (verse 4), on the mountain (often seen as a meeting place between heaven and earth (verse 6), and on earth again (verse10).\n- The rebellious words in verse 3 are echoed by similar sounding but very contrastive (obedient) words in verses 10–12. \n- The word for son in verse 12 is highlighted by being Aramaic rather than Hebrew and having several occurrences of similar sounding consonant groups near it.\n\n## Figurative language:\n\n- Nations are personified.\n- Yahweh’s rule is pictured as physical bonds.\n- Power is figured as an iron rod.\n- Nations are figured as pottery.\n\n### CCBYSA\n\nSignificant portions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 2](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_2) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
2:1	e4gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֭⁠מָּה רָגְשׁ֣וּ גוֹיִ֑ם וּ֝⁠לְאֻמִּ֗ים יֶהְגּוּ־רִֽיק	1	[Verses 4](../02/04.md) and following provide the proper understanding of the questions that make up this verse. They are not true questions; they are statements of mocking disbelief. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Nations are in turmoil and peoples are complaining uselessly.”
2:1	hd4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גוֹיִ֑ם	1	Here, **nations** represents either the people of the nations or the leaders of the nations. If **nations** could not be understood to **conspire**, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. However, it is best to not narrow the meaning to leaders yet, as the psalm will do that in the next verse. Alternate translation: “people from other nations”
2:1	xqez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo		0	What the **nations** are conspiring and the **peoples** are plotting is not mentioned in this verse, but since it becomes clear from the next two verses, you do not need to explain its meaning further here.
2:2	ag3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	יִ֥תְיַצְּב֨וּ ׀ מַלְכֵי־אֶ֗רֶץ וְ⁠רוֹזְנִ֥ים נֽוֹסְדוּ־יָ֑חַד	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth take their stand, indeed, the rulers conspire together”
2:3	bvs1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	נְֽ֭נַתְּקָה אֶת־מֽוֹסְרוֹתֵ֑י⁠מוֹ וְ⁠נַשְׁלִ֖יכָה מִמֶּ֣⁠נּוּ עֲבֹתֵֽי⁠מוֹ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Let us tear apart their bonds, truly, let us cast their cords away from us.”
2:3	xw9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נְֽ֭נַתְּקָה אֶת־מֽוֹסְרוֹתֵ֑י⁠מוֹ וְ⁠נַשְׁלִ֖יכָה מִמֶּ֣⁠נּוּ עֲבֹתֵֽי⁠מוֹ	1	The people of other nations speak of Yahweh and his anointed one's rule over them as if it were **bonds** and **cords**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “We should free ourselves from their control; we should not let them rule over us any longer”
2:4	vz39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	יוֹשֵׁ֣ב בַּ⁠שָּׁמַ֣יִם יִשְׂחָ֑ק אֲ֝דֹנָ֗⁠י יִלְעַג־לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “He who sits in the heavens sneers; indeed, the Lord mocks them.”
2:4	t9zx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יוֹשֵׁ֣ב	1	Here, **sitting** represents ruling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He who rules” (See also: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:5	z631		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְ⁠אַפּ֑⁠וֹ וּֽ⁠בַ⁠חֲרוֹנ֥⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **anger** and **fury**, you could express the same ideas in another way, as modeled by the UST.
2:6	ygss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations		0	This verse is a quotation of Yahweh (who is mentioned before this verse as the Lord who is sitting in the heavens). If the speaker would be unclear, you may want to introduce him as the UST does.
2:6	emc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וַ֭⁠אֲנִי	1	Yahweh says **I myself** to emphasize how significant it was that it was he and not someone else who was setting up this king on Zion. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “I alone”
2:6	v3q9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נָסַ֣כְתִּי	1	Scholars debate the meaning of this verb. However, all the options lead either symbolically or literally to the idea that Yahweh has made his king the ruler on Zion. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “installed” or “placed”
2:7	d5l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲסַפְּרָ֗ה אֶֽ֫ל חֹ֥ק יְֽהוָ֗ה אָמַ֘ר	1	The person saying this is the king that Yahweh placed in Zion. This is a change of speaker from the previous verse, though both are unmarked in the original. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The king says he will describe”
2:8	vjb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	נַחֲלָתֶ֑⁠ךָ וַ֝⁠אֲחֻזָּתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **inheritance** and **possession**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning another way. Alternate translation: “Your power is like an iron rod, which will shatter the nations, which are like mere clay pots.”
2:9	c2xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	כִּ⁠כְלִ֖י יוֹצֵ֣ר תְּנַפְּצֵֽ⁠ם	1	Using a simile in the second clause is a way to intensify the statement in biblical poetry. Use a method in your language’s poetic forms to intensify the second clause if possible. Alternate translation: “more than that, you will smash them to pieces like a jar of a potter”
2:9	ggd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כִּ⁠כְלִ֖י יוֹצֵ֣ר	1	A **potter** is a person who makes clay pots and jars. These are fragile and can be broken easily.

2:12	w4m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	נַשְּׁקוּ־בַ֡ר	1	To **kiss the son** is a symbolic action showing loyalty and pledged obedience. If this would not be clear to your readers, you can explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. People would show their king that they were loyal to him by kissing him, perhaps on the feet. Alternate translation: “Show the son that you are truly loyal to him” or “Bow down humbly before his son”
2:12	v3bs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠תֹ֬אבְדוּ דֶ֗רֶךְ	1	The implication is that the **son** will kill **you** if you do not **kiss** him. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and he kill you in the way”

3:intro	py7j				0	"# Psalm 3 General Notes\n\n## About the Psalm\n\n**Purpose:** to pray for salvation from enemies.\n**Content:** Yahweh, save me! My enemies are many, but you are my defense.\n**Message:** “Salvation is of Yahweh” ([3:8](../03/08.md))\n\n\n## Outline:\n- verse 1–2 Foes “rising” against psalmist\n- verse 3–4 Trust expressed to Yahweh (on his holy hill, see [Psalm 2:6](../02/06.md))\n- verses 5–6 Trust in Yahweh proclaimed\n- verses 7–8 Help petitioned from Yahweh (“rising” and saving refer back to verse 1–2)\n\nSee 2 Samuel 15–18 for the story of David fleeing from Absalom.\n\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n- The psalm divides into four sections that are nearly the same length (14 words / 14 words / 14 words / 15 words).\n- “Rising” and “salvation” are repeated between verses 2–3 and verses 8–9 in a negative and then positive way. This emphasizes that the author’s problems have been completely solved by Yahweh.\n- The second and third sections share similar beginnings; both begin with an independent personal pronoun (verse 3a: ""you;"" verse 5a: ""I""). ""You"" (=Yahweh) is the topic of the second section (verses 3–4), and ""I"" (=David) is the topic of the third section (verses 5–6).\n- The first section (verses 1–2) and the two middle sections (verses 3–6) are connected by the ideas of “many/multitudes ... against me.”\n\n\n## Figurative language:\n\n\n- Yahweh is pictured as a shield.\n- Safety is pictured as sleeping.\n- Yahweh’s salvation from enemies is pictured in violent graphic language.\n- Wicked people’s power is represented by their teeth.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n- **Selah**: This psalm contains the first instances of the Hebrew word **Selah**. Refer to the introduction to Psalms for more information.\n\n- Superscriptions : This psalm is the first instance which starts with an superscription. Refer to the introduction to Psalms for more information."
3:front	g1yb			לְ⁠דָוִ֑ד	1	This could mean: (1) David wrote the psalm or (2) the psalm is about David or (3) the psalm is in the style of David’s psalms.
3:1	xp7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	יְ֭הוָה מָֽה־רַבּ֣וּ צָרָ֑⁠י	1	The word **how** marks this as an exclamation that is emphasizing to Yahweh by an emotional outburst how very desperate the author’s situation is. Use an exclamation that would communicate that meaning in your language. Alternate translation: “Oh Yahweh, I have so many enemies!”
3:1	cj3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קָמִ֥ים עָלָֽ⁠י	1	Here, **risers against me** is an idiom that means “people who rebel against me” or “people who wish to fight me.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Those getting in my face” or “Those who rebel against me”
3:2	lhxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֵ֤ין יְֽשׁוּעָ֓תָ⁠ה לּ֬⁠וֹ בֵֽ⁠אלֹהִ֬ים	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Surely God will not save him”
3:2	oya5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	סֶֽלָה	1	This is the first instance of the Hebrew word **Selah**, the meaning of which is unknown. The Septuagint translates the term as διάψαλμα (diapsalma), meaning “musical interlude.” Your translation team should decide if you will (1) transliterate **Selah** or (2) omit **Selah** or (3) follow the Septuagint and translate something like “pause” into your language.
3:3	mj2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מָגֵ֣ן בַּעֲדִ֑⁠י	1	Here, **shield** represents protection. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you, Yahweh, protect me like a shield”
3:3	llc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּ֝בוֹדִ֗⁠י	1	Because **Yahweh** is the actor in all the other actions in this verse, calling **Yahweh** his **glory** probably means that **Yahweh** gives the author **glory** or honor. Since the author has just spoken about his enemies and Yahweh being his protector, he probably means that Yahweh gives him glory by giving him victory over his enemies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are the one who gives me glory” or “you are the one who gives me victory”
3:3	hj6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠מֵרִ֥ים רֹאשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Lifting the author’s **head** could mean (1) giving him courage or (2) giving him victory over his enemies or (3) restoring him to being king of Israel (given the context of David fleeing from his son’s usurping). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the one who encourages me” or “and the one who lifts me over my enemies” or “and the one who lifts me to the throne”
3:4	bz2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶקְרָ֑א וַ⁠יַּֽעֲנֵ֨⁠נִי	1	The implication is that the author is calling to Yahweh for help and that Yahweh’s answer takes the form of giving help. You can include this information if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I call for help … and he helped me”
3:5	tup6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֲנִ֥י שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי וָֽ⁠אִ֫ישָׁ֥נָ⁠ה הֱקִיצ֑וֹתִי כִּ֖י יְהוָ֣ה יִסְמְכֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Here, the phrase **for Yahweh protects me** is the reason for the result, **I awoke**, as well as the reason for the author’s confidence that he can lie down and sleep. The events **laid down and slept** are not one-time occurrences, but a universal statement about his daily peace because of Yahweh. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “Because Yahweh protects me, I lie down, sleep, and awake.”
3:6	q7wy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לֹֽא־אִ֭ירָא	1	The author does **not fear** because of Yahweh’s protection, mentioned in verse 5. Be sure that connection is clear in your language.
3:7	zax2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ק֘וּמָ֤⁠ה 	1	The author speaks of starting to do something as to **Rise up.** If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Take action” or “Do something”
3:7	az5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	הִכִּ֣יתָ אֶת־כָּל־אֹיְבַ֣⁠י לֶ֑חִי שִׁנֵּ֖י רְשָׁעִ֣ים שִׁבַּֽרְתָּ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Translate them according to the decisions your team has made regarding translating parallelism in Hebrew poetry. See the [book introduction](../front/intro.md) for more information. The phrases **my enemies** and **the wicked** refer to the same group of people. Alternate translation: “you hit all my enemies on the jaw; you even break those wicked enemies’ teeth” or “you destroy all my enemies”
3:7	r6xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	הִכִּ֣יתָ אֶת־כָּל־אֹיְבַ֣⁠י לֶ֑חִי	1	Hitting an enemy on the cheek was a way of insulting people. If this would not be clear to your readers, you can explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “For you will insult all my enemies like someone hitting them on the jaw”
3:7	k36i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִׁנֵּ֖י רְשָׁעִ֣ים שִׁבַּֽרְתָּ	1	Animals attack with their teeth. Breaking their teeth takes away their power to attack. David speaks as if Yahweh would come and physically fight against the wicked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you make the wicked unable to harm me like someone breaking the teeth of a ferocious animal”
3:8	x9bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לַ⁠יהוָ֥ה הַ⁠יְשׁוּעָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. The meaning of this phrase is that Yahweh is characterized by saving his people. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is the savior” or “Yahweh saves his people”
3:8	qkyu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עַֽל־ עַמְּ⁠ךָ֖ בִרְכָתֶ֣⁠ךָ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blessing**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Please bless your people” or “You always bless your people”
4:intro	b2qk				0	# Psalm 4 General Notes\n\n## Outline:\n- Superscription\n- verse 1 Distress \n- verses 2-6 Rebuke\n- verses 7-9 Blessing\n\n\n## About the Psalm\n\n**Purpose:** to intercede for the people and call them to repentance.\n**Content:** People, trust in Yahweh alone! He has relieved our suffering in the past, and he will help us again when I call to him. Yahweh, shine on us!\n**Message:** Yahweh alone gives peace and security in times of distress.\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n\n- Repetition features between verses 1, 6, and 8. See the note in [verse 6](../04/06.md).\n- Hebrew roots from verse 5 repeat in verses 7–9. See the note in [verse 5](../04/05.md).\n- There seems to be a morning and night pattern. The word translated **call** ([verse 1](../04/01.md)) and **cry** ([verse 3](../04/03.md)) sound like the Hebrew word for morning, and then bed is mentioned in [verse 4](../04/04.md). Yahweh lifting up the light of his face is like the dawn in [verse 6](../04/06.md) and in [verse 8](../04/08.md) the author lies down to sleep.\n- The last verse of the psalm seems to wind down peacefully, even repeating “sh” sounds. See the note in [verse 8](../04/08.md).\n\n\n### CCBYSA\n\nSignificant portions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 4](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_4) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

4:4	u9p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִמְר֣וּ בִ֭⁠לְבַבְ⁠כֶם\r	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Consider your thoughts and motives”
4:4	l67w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	אִמְר֣וּ בִ֭⁠לְבַבְ⁠כֶם עַֽל־מִשְׁכַּבְ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	The Hebrew root words for **speak**, **heart**, and **bed** in this verse appear in verses 7 (as “say”), 8, and 9 (as “lie down”) respectively (in the same order). Consider if a similar pattern would create a natural poetic effect in your language.

You may wish to explore whether you can reflect this symmetry in a natural way in your language.

6:intro	gpl3				0	# Psalm 6 General Notes\n\n## Outline:\n\n- Superscription\n- verses 1–5 Plea\n- verses 6–7 Death\n- verses 8–10 Answer\n\nThe psalm divides neatly in half between verses 5 and 6 with 34 words in each. The first half divides into two parts, verses 1–2 and verses 4–5, which parallel each other in structure and content. \n\n## About the Psalm\n\nPurpose: to plead for mercy and healing\n\nContent: Yahweh have mercy and heal me, because I am near death, and no one can praise you in death.\n\nMessage: Yahweh’s loyalty to David is stronger than sin and death ([Psalm 30:6](../30/06.md).)\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n\n- The first section (verses 1–3) and the last section (verses 8–10) are parallel. Not only are they the same length (3 verses, 6 lines), but they are also similar in content and sounds. Structurally, the first section and the last section stand in a symmetrical relationship to one another. The parallels help to define the structure of the psalm.\n\n- The effect of the repetition in the last section is to highlight the complete resolution and reversal of the situation. David’s prayer has been heard, his question of "How long?" has been answered ("in an instant!"), and the deep dismay that he experienced is now imparted to his enemies on whom Yahweh’s punishment rightfully falls.\n\n- The second section (verses 6–7) stands out in a number of ways, including figurative language, line structure, use of rare words, alliteration, delay of information, word repetition, and use of similar-sounding words. The effect is to draw attention to this section of the poem, wherein David, on the brink of death, reaches to the heights of poetic/rhetorical technique in order to express the depths of his suffering in a last-ditch effort to persuade Yahweh to rescue him.\n\n- Yahweh’s name appears eight times throughout the psalm, but it is conspicuously absent from the second section (verses 6–7), which follows the Psalmist's statement that “in death, there is no remembrance of you” (verse 5a). \n\n In verses 6–7, it is as though David has descended into the world of the dead, the place where Yahweh is neither named or praised. It is a place of darkness (**night**) and associated with watery chaos (**tears/swim/melt**). In the last section (verses 8–10), David regains energy, confidence, and authority, and he proclaims Yahweh’s name three times, as though he has come back from the dead.\n\n- Almost every verse in this psalm displays parallelism. Verse 2 and the first line of verse 3 are a three-part parallel while the last line of verse 3 and the first line of verse 4 seem to be the only lines not in a parallelism construction. While all these phrases mean basically the same thing with the second emphasizing the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words, Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]].)\n\n### CCBYSA\n\nSignificant portions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 6](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_6) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n"

7:intro	zey1				0	# Psalm 7 General Notes\n\n## Outline:\n\n\n- Superscription\n\n- verses 1–5 Injustice Rejected\n- verses 6–9 Justice Requested\n- verses 10–16 Justice Expected\n- verse 17 Justice Praised\n\n## About the Psalm\n\n**Purpose:** to invoke justice from Yahweh towards both the righteous (specifically, himself) and the wicked (false accusers).\n\n**Content:** God is a righteous judge. He saves the upright, and he brings the end to the wicked’s violence.\n\n**Message:** King Yahweh will see to it that the wicked receive their punishment and that the righteous are vindicated.\n\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n### Heights and Depths\nProvides the structure of the Psalm.\n1. The Psalmist is brought down (vv. 1-5)\n2. Yahweh goes up to the highest place (vv. 6-9)\n3. The enemies are brought down (vv.10-16)\n4. Praise to the Most High God (v.17)\n\n\n### Other\n- There are a number of explicit and implicit references to Yahweh as both warrior and judge, which are both important functions of a king, especially King Yahweh—a metaphor that runs throughout the Psalms.\n- The subject in verses 12-16 is ambiguous, only the pronoun “he” is used (but it must be the wicked in verses 14-16). The psalmist might have chosen to leave the participants grammatically ambiguous in this entire section to create tension in what is a prominent section of the psalm (which is it, Yahweh or the wicked?!), as well as to teach an important lesson in line with the meaning of this psalm: to be wicked is to bring death upon oneself; but Yahweh is the one who ensures the destruction. In the UST and notes, the most likely persons are identified.\n\n### Cush the Benjamite\n\nNote the superscription and the specific circumstances. There is no other reference to this incident in the Scriptures. But there are references to David being opposed by those of the tribe of Benjamin during the time he was serving King Saul.\n\n\n### CCBYSA\n\nPortions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 7](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_7) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

7:3-5	dpor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry		0	In some languages, translating verses 3-5 might require a significant rearrangement to make the meaning clear. This section presents a hypothetical situation where the author calls a potential curse onto himself. You might have to connect each hypothetical situation in verses 3-4 with a consequence in verse 5, or even put verse 5 before the hypotheticals.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to notice that both verses 3-4 and verse 5 build up to a greater level of tension, with the peak of this tension at the end of verse 5. As you translate, try to capture this growing sense of hypothetical sin and its consequences, doing so in a way that feels natural to the poetic style of your language.

He’s making the case that he’s not guilty.\n\nWhen translating, use a form in your language that introduces a condition the speaker doesn’t believe is true (similar to how it’s done in the UST).\n\nBe careful, though: if you choose to translate it as a statement of the opposite, as seen in an alternate translation, you’ll need to also change the wording in verse 5 to reflect this negation, as shown at the end of the provided example. \n\n\nAlternate translation: “since I have not done this, and since there is no wrong on my hands, since I have not repaid evil to one who was at peace with me, or senselessly rescued my adversary, then do not”

7:4	wph2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֲחַלְּצָ֖⁠ה צוֹרְרִ֣⁠י רֵיקָֽם	1	This could mean: (1) being an unfaithful friend by saving a person who is the author’s and his ally’s enemy. Alternate translation: “or saved my enemy for no reason” (2) not attacking even an enemy without immediate cause (in this case the verb translated rescue could be taken as plunder). Alternate translation: “or plundered my enemy without cause” (3) not only not doing evil to friends, but even doing good to enemies. In this case the phrase would be less logically connected to the previous one. Alternate translation: “. And I even rescue one who is my enemy without reason.”

Here, waking up represents starting to do something or take action. It does not imply that the author thinks Yahweh is asleep. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Take action” or “Start to do this”
7:6	lvmj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	מִשְׁפָּ֥ט צִוִּֽיתָ	1	This wording serves a dual function: it both justifies the demands made earlier in this verse and sets the stage for the expectations expressed in the following verses. When translating, consider how to maintain this two-fold connection in your language, ensuring that it aligns with the logical and emotional flow of the text.

7:9	pw1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	רַ֨ע	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “evil things”
7:9	zql9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ֭בּ֗וֹת וּ⁠כְלָי֗וֹת	1	The **hearts and kidneys** are internal organs that represent people’s thoughts and desires in the author’s culture.

7:12-13	y4zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חַרְבּ֣⁠וֹ יִלְט֑וֹשׁ	1	In verses 12 and 13, David speaks of God deciding to punish the wicked as if God were a warrior preparing to fight against them with weapons.

Alternate translation: “God will prepare the punish him like a warrior prepares to fight by sharpening his sword”

The second and third emphasize the meaning by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the later phrases are repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he who is pregnant with wickedness, who also conceives trouble, who even births lies”
7:14	l54a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְחַבֶּל־אָ֑וֶן וְ⁠הָרָ֥ה עָ֝מָ֗ל וְ⁠יָ֣לַד שָֽׁקֶר	1	nThe author speaks of the things that a wicked person does as if the person were **pregnant** and **wickedness**, **trouble**, and **lies** are the baby.  If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Just as a woman conceives a child, carries it to term, and gives birth to it, So evil people think of wrong things to do, they do those wrong things, and then they lie about what they have done.” or “the person ready to do wicked things. He makes plans for trouble and produces lies”
7:14	hkfd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְחַבֶּל	1	Here the subject switches from God back to the evil person. Alternate translation: “the wicked person is pregnant”

It may be strange in some languages to use a masculine pronoun when talking about someone being pregnant or giving birth, even in a figure of speech.  If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural expression. Alternate translation: “the person pregnant with wickedness, who conceives trouble, who births lies”
7:16	p524		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָשׁ֣וּב עֲמָל֣⁠וֹ בְ⁠רֹאשׁ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠עַ֥ל קָ֝דְקֳד֗⁠וֹ חֲמָס֥⁠וֹ יֵרֵֽד	1	Here, **trouble** and **violence** are spoken of as if they hit a person’s head or fall down on it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His own destructive plans destroy him, for his violence attacks him” or “When he plans to trouble others, others trouble him; when he attacks others, others attack him”

Alternate translation: “His troubling others returns on his head, and his violently attacking others comes down on the top of his head”
7:17	v8ss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כְּ⁠צִדְק֑⁠וֹ & וַ֝⁠אֲזַמְּרָ֗ה 	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **righteousness** and **praise**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “because he is righteous … and sing a praise song”
7:17	nxd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שֵֽׁם־יְהוָ֥ה	1	Here, **name** represents reputation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh’s reputation”

You bestow your glory on the heavens above, and you bestow glory on weak humans below.\n\n**Message:** Yahweh’s majesty is revealed in weakness.\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n- The psalm begins and ends with the exact same exclamation - this serves to point out the purpose of the psalm.\n\n- The psalm progresses from top to bottom several times. In verse 1b-2 it goes from the heavens down to the weakest of humans. Verses 3-4 again go down from the heavens to man. Verses 5-8 move from the heavenly beings through man, who is exalted and crowned with glory as Yahweh’s representative ruler of all creation and down and out into creation in circles moving away from man’s primary spheres of dominion (domestic animals) progressively outward.\n- There are many echoes of Genesis 1. References include: the heavens as created by Yahweh’s fingers (verse 3), the animals as made by his hands (verse 6), the dominion of man over creation (verses 6-8, see also Genesis 1:26).\n- Magnificent, Majesty, Splendor, Glory: Yahweh gives his weak representative (humans) many of his glorious attributes and humans rule for Yahweh.\n\n\n### CCBYSA\n\nPortions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 8](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_8) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \n\nSee their [top three exegetical issues in Psalm 8 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5-NpONilOs) for discussion of verses 1, 2, and 5 and their [top three poetic features of Psalm 8 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcRob_g2g2Q) on YouTube.

8:2	tiix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	מִ⁠פִּ֤י עֽוֹלְלִ֨ים ׀ וְֽ⁠יֹנְקִים֮	1	**Out of the mouth of children and nursing ones** is placed at the front of the sentence here to help create a strong sense of surprise that this weak thing would be the means that Yahweh uses to establish **strength**. Consider using a poetic method in your language to make the connection of the weak and strong surprising.

8:2	psmo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פִּ֤י	1	Here, **mouth** represents the babies’ crying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “From the crying of”
8:2	zvjj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	עֽוֹלְלִ֨ים ׀ וְֽ⁠יֹנְקִים֮	1	The two words translated **children** and **nursing ones** may express a single idea. The word **nursing** further describes the age or state of the**children**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a different way. Alternate translation: “nursing babies”
8:2	gmb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	עֹ֥ז	1	The Hebrew reads “strength.” The ULT follows that reading. The ancient Greek translation reads “praise.” The Greek version is quoted in [Matthew 21:16](../mat/21/16.md).

If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
8:2	undk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עֹ֥ז	1	Because the word translated **established** is strongly associated with making a building, here, **strength** probably represents a fortress (a strong building that can be defended easily). Kings or Lords, as Yahweh is depicted in verse 1, often built fortresses to protect their domains and people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a building that is easy to defend”
8:2	x1wp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֽוֹלְלִ֨ים ׀ וְֽ⁠יֹנְקִים֮	1	Because of the parallelism between verse 2 and verse 4, **children and nursing ones** may represent all of humanity (as weak and helpless people needing Yahweh’s protection).

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. These remarks have been expressed in the form of a question to add emphasis. Alternate translation: “It is amazing that you are concerned for people and are care about them!”

It could be in their status somehow or in their perceived glory and majesty. Because of this ambiguity it would be best not to try to explain this **lack** in your translation.
8:5	hx3s			מֵ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים 	1	The Hebrew word here could mean: 1) **heavenly beings**. This generic term encompasses any sorts of supernatural beings in the heavens that humans are slightly less than (like the heavenly court in Job 1). 2) God. The most common translation for this word is God. However, the author is speaking to Yahweh in this psalm, so if he meant God here it would make more sense for him to say ‘from you.’  3) angels. The ancient Greek translation uses this option, but this Hebrew word does not seem to mean angels elsewhere.

8:5	gr58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠כָב֖וֹד וְ⁠הָדָ֣ר	1	The terms **glory** and **majesty** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis.

9:intro	zq96				0	# Psalm 9 General Notes\n\n## Psalms 9–10 as One Psalm\n\nThis psalm has a superscription but Psalm 10 does not. This fact and the acrostic nature of the two psalms (lines start with consecutive letters of the alphabet) has lead many scholars to believe these two psalms may have originally been written as one psalm. The analysis of the structure of these psalms presented here will assume that. It is recommended that you follow the versification and chapter structure of other Bibles you are familiar with.\n\n## Outline:\nThe outlines for psalms 9 and 10 are combined here and in the introduction to psalm 10 because  they were probably originally one psalm. Your translation will probably be best if you translate them together.\n\n- Superscription\n- verses 1–10 Praise of the King\n    - verses 1–4 Praise the righteous God, for he terrifies the wicked.\n    - verses 5–6 Yahweh destroyed the wicked.\n    - verses 7–10 Yahweh sits enthroned to do justice for the afflicted\n- verses 11–20 Petition the King\n    - verses 11–14 He did not ignore the afflicted.\n    - verses 15–16 He ensnared the wicked!\n    - verses 17–20 The wicked will come to nothing.\nPsalm 10:\n- verses 1–11 Persecution of the Poor\n    - verses 1–6 God stands far off; the wicked say, I will not be shaken. (check ULT 10:6)\n    - verses 7–11 The wicked sit in ambush and say, God has been ignoring (check ULT 10:11)\n- verses 12–18 Proclamation of the King\n    - verses 12–14 God *does* see. Rise up, Yahweh. (check ult 10:12)\n    - verses 15–18 Yahweh is King forever. The afflicted will never fear again.\n\n## About the Psalm\n\n**Purpose:** To petition the divine king to the aid of the oppressed.\n\n**Content:** Rise up, Yahweh! You've avenged the oppressed in the past but You are now standing at a distance.\n\n**Message:** Yahweh has established his throne for justice (9:7b).\n\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\r\n\n\r\n\n#### Order and chaos\r\n\nThe first letter of many of the lines of these two psalms follows an acrostic (alphabetic) pattern. In some places, however, this orderly pattern is interrupted. The places where it is interrupted are places where the wicked are mentioned or acting. It is as if the presence of the wicked disrupts the orderliness over even the poetry, but it is restored and kept by Yahweh. If your language has a poetic style which can indicate order and chaos, you may wish to translate:\r\n\n- 9:1–4 in an orderly style\r\n- 9:5–6 in a slightly chaotic style\r\n- 9:7–15 in an orderly style\r\n- 9:16–17 in a slightly chaotic style\r\n- 9:18 in neither\r\n- 9:19–20 in an orderly style\r\n- 10:1 in an orderly style\r\n- 10:2–11 in a very chaotic style\r\n- 10:12–18 in an orderly style\r\n\r\n#### The fortress and the pit\r\n\r\nThere are two chiasms in psalm 9. In the first half, Yahweh is compared to a fortress (verse 9) and, poetically, his judgment forms a barrier between the enemies and the psalmist and the oppressed.\r\n\r\n- A 9:1–2 people trust Yahweh\r\n    - B 9:3-4 Yahweh is a judge\r\n        - C 9:5–6 The enemy\r\n    - B 9:7-8 Yahweh is a king and judge\r\n- A 9:9–10 people trust Yahweh\r\n\r\nIn the second half, people’s prayers poetically encircle the wicked, causing them to fall into their own pit.\r\n- A 9:11–14 people pray to Yahweh for help (especially verse 13) \r\n    - B 9:15-18 the wicked are destroyed by their own pit\r\n- A 9:19-20 people pray to Yahweh for help\r\n\r\nAs you translate this psalm, you will probably have a structure that matches this which may or may not be meaningful in your language. You could also consider if there is a way to poetically “surround” the wicked with Yahweh as judge and the prayers of his people in the two sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Adjectives used as generic nouns:\r\n- The adjectives **wicked, afflicted, innocent,** and **oppressed** are nominal adjectives used as generic nouns in these psalms.

The cause of the wicked nations being trapped by their own traps is Yahweh doing justice, the result is that he is revealed as being just.

9:17-18	qi1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry		0	Verses 17-18 form a poetic device called a chiasm where the inner two lines parallel each other and the outer two lines also parallel each other. In this case this artistic device creates a strong contrast between the verses by contrasting forgetting God with his not forgetting the needy, and contrasts the death of the wicked with the hope of the afflicted which does not die. If you language has a poetic structure than can make contrasts stand out markedly like this consider using it here.
9:18	f28n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֹ֣א לָ֭⁠נֶצַח יִשָּׁכַ֣ח אֶבְי֑וֹן	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God will not always forget the needy”

There are two points: 1) nations do not last forever, they pass away or are mortal like humans and 2) the leaders of nations are not gods, but humans who die. In both instances, they need to recognize that Yahweh is the supreme, never-ending power. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May nations know they are temporary” or “May wicked human kings stop pretending to be eternal gods”
10:intro	h366				0	# Psalm 10 General Notes\n\n## Psalms 9–10 as One Psalm\n\nPsalm 9 has a superscription but Psalm 10 does not. This fact and the acrostic nature of the two psalms (lines start with consecutive letters of the alphabet) has lead many scholars to believe these two psalms may have originally been written as one psalm. The analysis of the structure of these psalms presented here will assume that. It is recommended that you follow the versification and chapter structure of other Bibles you are familiar with.\n\n## Outline:\nThe outlines for psalms 9 and 10 are combined here and in the introduction to psalm 9 because they were probably originally one psalm. Your translation will probably be best if you translate them together.\n\n- Superscription\n- verses 1–10 Praise of the King\n    - verses 1–4 Praise the righteous God, for he terrifies the wicked.\n    - verses 5–6 Yahweh destroyed the wicked.\n    - verses 7–10 Yahweh sits enthroned to do justice for the afflicted\n- verses 11–20 Petition the King\n    - verses 11–14 He did not ignore the afflicted.\n    - verses 15–16 He ensnared the wicked!\n    - verses 17–20 The wicked will come to nothing.\n\n**Psalm 10:**\n- verses 1–11 Persecution of the Poor\n    - verses 1–6 God stands far off; the wicked say, I will not be shaken. (check ULT 10:6)\n    - verses 7–11 The wicked sit in ambush and say, God has been ignoring (check ULT 10:11)\n- verses 12–18 Proclamation of the King\n    - verses 12–14 God *does* see. Rise up, Yahweh. (check ult 10:12)\n    - verses 15–18 Yahweh is King forever. The afflicted will never fear again.\n\n## About the Psalm\n\n**Purpose:** To petition the divine king to the aid of the oppressed.\n\n**Content:** Rise up, Yahweh! You’ve avenged the oppressed in the past but You are now standing at a distance.\n\n**Message:** Yahweh has established his throne for justice (9:7b).\n\n\n## Poetic Elements (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]]):\n\n#### Order and chaos\nThe first letter of many of the lines of these two psalms follows an acrostic (alphabetic) pattern. In some places, however, this orderly pattern is interrupted. The places where it is interrupted are places where the wicked are mentioned or acting. It is as if the presence of the wicked disrupts the orderliness over even the poetry, but it is restored and kept by Yahweh. If your language has a poetic style which can indicate order and chaos, you may wish to translate:\n- 9:1–4 in an orderly style\n- 9:5–6 in a slightly chaotic style\n- 9:7–15 in an orderly style\n- 9:16–17 in a slightly chaotic style\n- 9:18 in neither\n- 9:19–20 in an orderly style\n- 10:1 in an orderly style\n- 10:2–11 in a very chaotic style\n- 10:12–18 in an orderly style\n\n#### The fortress and the pit\n\nThere are two chiasms in psalm 9. In the first half, Yahweh is compared to a fortress (verse 9) and, poetically, his judgment forms a barrier between the enemies and the psalmist and the oppressed.\n\n- A 9:1–2 people trust Yahweh\n    - B 9:3-4 Yahweh is a judge\n        - C 9:5–6 The enemy\n    - B 9:7-8 Yahweh is a king and judge\n- A 9:9–10 people trust Yahweh\n\nIn the second half, people’s prayers poetically encircle the wicked, causing them to fall into their own pit.\n- A 9:11–14 people pray to Yahweh for help (especially verse 13) \n    - B 9:15-18 the wicked are destroyed by their own pit\n- A 9:19-20 people pray to Yahweh for help\n\nAs you translate this psalm, you will probably have a structure that matches this which may or may not be meaningful in your language. You could also consider if there is a way to poetically “surround” the wicked with Yahweh as judge and the prayers of his people in the two sections.\n\n\n### Adjectives used as generic nouns:\n- The adjectives **wicked, afflicted, innocent,** and **oppressed** are nominal adjectives used as generic nouns in these psalms. See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]].\n\n### CCBYSA\n\nPortions of the ULT, UST, and TNs for this psalm are derivative from [“Psalms, Layer by Layer”](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), [Psalm 10](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Psalm_10) by Cambridge Digital Bible Research, Katie Frost, Meaghan Smith, Nikki Mustin et al, used under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \n\nSee their [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRQZ1eytMJ8) and [top three exegetical issues in Psalm 10 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4w8G32hfyI) and their [top three poetic features of Psalms 9-10 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moXvQUAMudo) on YouTube.
10:1	l729		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ⁠מָ֣ה יְ֭הוָה תַּעֲמֹ֣ד בְּ⁠רָח֑וֹק תַּ֝עְלִ֗ים לְ⁠עִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה	1	The speaker is using the question form to express his distress that Yahweh has not helped him. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, it seems as though you are far away from me and you hide from me whenever I am in trouble.”
10:1	krgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠עִתּ֥וֹת בַּצָּרָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when we are troubled”

In that case this would either be a prediction or wish. This would fit with what is said in [9:15–16](../09/15.md).  Alternate translation: “the wicked are caught by the schemes that they themselves have planned” or “may the wicked be caught by the schemes that they themselves have planned” 2) the first **they** is the **oppressed** and the second is the **wicked**. This would fit with the very negative outlook of 10:1–11. Alternate translation: “the oppressed are caught by the schemes that the wicked have planned” You may wish to follow the choice that translations you are familiar with have made.

10:3	wf55			וּ⁠בֹצֵ֥עַ בֵּ֝רֵ֗ךְ נִ֘אֵ֥ץ ׀ יְהוָֽה	1	It is difficult to discern who is the subject and object of both verbs in the second half of this verse. Additionally, some believe that **blesses** is an euphemism for “curses” here. The ULT seeks to offer a reasonable translation where **the wicked** is the subject throughout (occurrences of **he** in the ULT refer to **the wicked**). You may wish to follow the rendering of a translation in your region that you are familiar with.

It is unclear *who* does not seek *what* here. It could be that 1) the wicked **seeks not** God. They do not fear him or obey him. 2) the wicked thinks that God does not seek them out, or notice them, to punish them. Alternate translation: “thinks God seeks not” You could supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. \n

This could mean 1) Yahweh’s judgements are far from his thinking, he ignores them. 2) he does not understand Yahweh’s judgements. Alternate translation: “your judgements are beyond his comprehension” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He pays no attention to your judgements”
10:5	bbt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	כָּל־צ֝וֹרְרָ֗י⁠ו יָפִ֥יחַ בָּ⁠הֶֽם	1	Here, **snorts** (blowing air loudly out of the nose) is a symbolic action that expresses contempt and mocking.

Alternate translation: “he shows that he thinks that all his enemies are weak and worthless” or “he sneers at all his enemies”
10:6	j7qk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בַּל־אֶמּ֑וֹט	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Nothing can shake me”
10:6	xus1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לְ⁠דֹ֥ר וָ֝⁠דֹ֗ר	1	**To generation and generation** is an extreme statement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “at any possible time”

10:7	xj9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תַּ֥חַת לְ֝שׁוֹנ֗⁠וֹ	1	Here the **tongue** represents speaking.

10:9	sd5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠אַרְיֵ֬ה בְ⁠סֻכֹּ֗⁠ה	1	This is saying that the wicked are **like a lion** because they hide, lying it wait to ambush their prey like a lion does.

10:9	jkf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	יֶאֱרֹ֬ב בַּ⁠מִּסְתָּ֨ר ׀ כְּ⁠אַרְיֵ֬ה בְ⁠סֻכֹּ֗⁠ה יֶ֭אֱרֹב לַ⁠חֲט֣וֹף עָנִ֑י	1	In order to follow the original and highlight the parallelism with the previous verse, the ULT leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. In English **ambushes** requires an object. You could supply these words or modify the sentence structure if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “He ambushes the afflicted in secret like a lion in cover; he ambushes them to seize them” or “He waits secretly in ambush like a lion in cover; he waits to ambush and seize the afflicted” or “He lies in wait in secret like a lion in cover; he lies in wait to seize the afflicted”

10:11	xd2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	בַּל־רָאָ֥ה לָ⁠נֶֽצַח	1	This is an exaggeration to emphasize the wicked person's belief that God will never intervene or punish him.

You could supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. It is more clear here than in [verse 3](../10/03.md) who is seeking what. The wicked thinks that God does not seek them out, or notice them, to punish them.  Alternate translation: “You will not punish me”

10:14	je96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עָ֘מָ֤ל וָ⁠כַ֨עַס	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **mischief** and **vexation**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “the mischievous and vexing things they do”

If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very wicked” or “very evil” 
10:15	m5mv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּֽדְרוֹשׁ־רִשְׁע֥⁠וֹ בַל־תִּמְצָֽא	1	There is significant debate about who or what is **seek**ing and **find**ing. The interpretation suggested here is that the wicked and evil people’s arm (power for harm) is personified as looking to do the evil they have planned but is unable to because Yahweh has broken the arm (power). [For more information see the Psalms layer by layer exegetical discussion.](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/The_Division_of_Psalm_10:15) If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May the wicked, evil person try to use his power for harm but discover you have destroyed it.” Another common interpretation is that Yahweh will seek out (hunt down, punish) the wicked, evil person’s wickedness until he can no longer find it (because it is eradicated). Alternate translation: “Hunt down his wickedness until no more can be found” You may wish to follow the interpretation of a translation commonly used in your region.\n

If it would be helpful, you can use the plural form for these words.\n\n### You are my king\n\n\nIn [44:4](../44/04.md), the author speaks about God as his king. The author says this to express that Yahweh is the one true king over all of the earth, in contrast to any earthly king.\n

73:intro	t2n1				0	# Psalm 073 General Notes\n\n## Type of psalm\n\nPsalm 73 is a wisdom psalm. It explains the problem of wicked people who seem to prosper. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])\n\n## Outline:\n\n- Superscription: "A psalm of Asaph"\n- verse 1 Affirmation that God is good to the righteous\n- verses 2–12 The psalmist recounts his experience of seeing wicked people prosper and being envious of them \n- verses 13–14 The psalmist recounts that he felt he had lived righteously in vain because the result was that he suffered daily\n- verse 15 The psalmist decides not to speak his thoughts out loud \n- verse 16 The psalmist struggles to understand why wicked people seem to prosper and he suffers\n- verses 17-20 The psalmist goes to the sanctuary of God and understands what will happen to wicked people in the future\n- verses 21-22 The psalmist admits he was wrong to think the way he did\n- verses 23-26 The psalmist’s thoughts about the benefits of living righteously\n- verses 27-28 The psalmist’s final thoughts \n\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Evil people\n\nSometimes it seems that wicked people have no problems and that they live an easy and problem free life. Despite this, wicked people will eventually perish (verses 18-19 and 27). In contrast, righteous people have the benefit of always having God’s presence with them during their life on earth (verse 23), God guiding them during their life on earth (verse 24a), and being with God in “glory” after they die. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### Psalms by Asaph\n\nThere are twelve psalms attributed to Asaph; the first one is Psalm 50, which is in Book Two, and the other eleven (Psalm 73–83) are at the beginning of Book Three.
73:1	ns5l			מִזְמ֗וֹר לְ⁠אָ֫סָ֥ף	1	This phrase is the superscription to this psalm. Format it in the way that you have decided to format all of the superscriptions in the book of Psalms.
73:1	r1x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אַ֤ךְ	1	The author uses the word **Surely** to emphasize the truth of what follows. Use a natural form in your language for expressing this emphasis.
73:1	lvkt			לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל	1	Alternate translation: “to the people who belong to the nation of Isreal” 
73:1	gmac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠בָרֵ֥י לֵבָֽב	1	Here, the author speaks of the **heart** of righteous people as being **pure** by which he means that their hearts are not blemished by wrong and sinful thoughts in contrast to having a **heart** is impure because of sinful thoughts and motives and therefore morally dirty. What the author means by **pure** here is that the person’s **heart** is “morally pure.”  If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the ones who think about and want what is pleasing to God” or “to those with a morally pure heart” 
73:1	vixo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠בָרֵ֥י לֵבָֽב	1	In Jewish culture people considered the **heart** to be the center of a persons thoughts and feelings and here, the **heart** represents the intentions, thoughts and desires of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to those who think about and want what is pure” or “to those with a pure mind” or “to those with pure thoughts” 
73:2	bq59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֭⁠מְעַט נָטָ֣יוּ רַגְלָ֑⁠י כְּ֝⁠אַ֗יִן שֻׁפְּכ֥וּ אֲשֻׁרָֽ⁠י	1	Here, **my feet** and **my steps** represent the Psalmist himself and the phrases **slipped** and **slide out** refer to abandoning doing what pleases God and instead choosing to sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent metaphor or use a simile. Alternately, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I was tempted to stop obeying God. It was as if my feet almost slipped and as if my steps were almost caused to slide out from under me” or “I almost stopped trusting in God; I was almost guilty of sinning against him”
73:2	nz6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּ֭⁠מְעַט נָטָ֣יוּ רַגְלָ֑⁠י כְּ֝⁠אַ֗יִן שֻׁפְּכ֥וּ אֲשֻׁרָֽ⁠י	1	The phrase **my feet almost slipped** and the phrase **my steps almost were caused to slide out from under me** mean basically the same thing. The Psalmist says the same thing twice for emphasis and poetic effect. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “my feet almost slipped” or “my feet almost slid out from under me” 
73:2	gfpo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כְּ֝⁠אַ֗יִן שֻׁפְּכ֥וּ אֲשֻׁרָֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the following verse implies that the Psalmist caused his own **steps** to almost **slide out** from under him when he looked at the “prosperity of the wicked” and did not also immediately go into “God’s sanctuary” so that he could “understand” the final “fate” of the wicked (see Psalm 73:17). Alternate translation: “I almost caused my steps to slide out from under me” 
73:3	joi8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Here, the word **because** indicates that what follows it in this verse is the reason for what precedes it in [73:2](../73/02.md)). Use a natural form for indicating this relationship. Alternate translation: “for” 
73:3	vfwj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	קִ֭נֵּאתִי בַּֽ⁠הוֹלְלִ֑ים שְׁל֖וֹם רְשָׁעִ֣ים אֶרְאֶֽה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “when I saw the prosperity of the wicked, I was envious of the arrogant” 
71:1	bmtl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אַ֤ךְ	1	The author is using the word **surely** to emphasize what he says next. Use a natural form in your language to express this emphasis.
73:3	jit7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בַּֽ⁠הוֹלְלִ֑ים שְׁל֖וֹם רְשָׁעִ֣ים אֶרְאֶֽה	1	The Psalmist is using the adjectives **arrogant** and **wicked** as nouns in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “of arrogant people when I saw the prosperity of wicked people” or “of the people who are arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the people who are wicked” 
73:3	k8tb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְׁל֖וֹם רְשָׁעִ֣ים אֶרְאֶֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **prosperity**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “prospered” as modeled by the UST, or you could express the idea in some other way that is natural in your language.
73:4	czr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חַרְצֻבּ֥וֹת	1	The word the ULT translates as **ropes** refers to **ropes** or “bonds” that constrain a person. Here, the author is speaking of struggles or pains as if they were **ropes** or “bonds” that constrain a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent expression or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “struggles” or “emotional pains” or “pains” 
73:4	i1yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠מוֹתָ֗⁠ם	1	The word the ULT translates as **until their death** could refer to: (1) the time before the **death** of wicked people in which case you can use the ULT as a model. (2) the time at which wicked people die. Alternate translation: “in their death” or “at their death” 
73:5	koji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠עֲמַ֣ל אֱנ֣וֹשׁ אֵינֵ֑⁠מוֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea with a verb or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They do not have to experience difficult things like the rest of man” or “They do not suffer the way other men do” 
73:5	ct2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ & וְ⁠עִם־אָ֝דָ֗ם לֹ֣א יְנֻגָּֽעוּ	1	In this verse, the word **man** is singular in form, but it refers to all human beings as a group (and includes both men and women). If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this plainly. Alternate translation: “people … and with other people” or “other people … and they are not afflicted ike everyone else” 
73:5	j4nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠עִם־אָ֝דָ֗ם לֹ֣א יְנֻגָּֽעוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “and God does not afflict them like he does the rest of man” or “and God does not afflict them like he does everyone else” 
73:6	v8ki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לָ֭⁠כֵן	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces the result of [73:4-5](../73/04.md). You can use a natural word or phrase in your language to express this relationship. Alternate translation: “As a result” 
73:6	r8m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֲנָקַ֣תְ⁠מוֹ גַאֲוָ֑ה	1	The author is speaking of **pride** as if it were a **necklace** that wicked people wear around their neck. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they wear pride like a necklace” or “pride is like a necklace which they flaunt” 
73:6	lfxp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עֲנָקַ֣תְ⁠מוֹ גַאֲוָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **pride**, you could express the same idea with an adverb or adjective or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they act pridefully for all to see like someone who wears a necklace that they want everyone to see” or “they unashamedly act proud in front of everyone like a person wearing a necklace that they want everyone to see”
73:6	scs1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עֲנָקַ֣תְ⁠מוֹ	1	A **necklace** is a type of jewelry worn around the neck in order to adorn the body and make a person look more attractive. If your readers would not be familiar with necklaces, you could use the name of something similar in your area worn around the neck for the purpose of looking nice or you could use a more general term. Alternately, if you are using footnotes, you could make a footnote explaining what a **necklace** is. Alternate translation: “a neck ornament for them”
73:6	c2uh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יַעֲטָף־שִׁ֝֗ית חָמָ֥ס לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The author is speaking of **violence** as it were a **garment** that people wear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “violence covers them like a garment” or “violence covers them like clothing”
73:6	ijmz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יַעֲטָף־שִׁ֝֗ית חָמָ֥ס לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **violence**, you could express the same idea with an adjective or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they are proud of their violent actions and display them openly, like a person who wears a garment for all to see” 
73:7	ttd1			יָ֭צָא מֵ⁠חֵ֣לֶב עֵינֵ֑⁠מוֹ	1	Alternate translation: “Their eyes bulge out from their fat faces” 
73:7	trsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עָ֝בְר֗וּ מַשְׂכִּיּ֥וֹת לֵבָֽב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **imaginations**, you could express the same idea with a verb or in some other way that is natural in your language.

73:7	l8fr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עָ֝בְר֗וּ מַשְׂכִּיּ֥וֹת לֵבָֽב	1	Here, the author speaks of the **heart** of a wicked person as if it were a container that could overflow with evil **imaginations** (thoughts).

73:7	vux4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עָ֝בְר֗וּ מַשְׂכִּיּ֥וֹת לֵבָֽב	1	The author is describing the mind of wicked people by association with their **heart**, which is where a persons thoughts and intentions were viewed as coming from in Jewish culture. If your readers would not understand this, you could use plain language or use the body part that your culture considers to be the source of human’s thoughts and intentions. Alternate translation: “they constantly think of evil things to do” or “the imaginations of their inner being overflow” 
73:8	fmq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וִ⁠ידַבְּר֣וּ בְ⁠רָ֣ע עֹ֑שֶׁק	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **evil** and **oppression**, you could express these same ideas with an adverb or a verb or in some other way that is natural in your language.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “”
73:9	zv4q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שַׁתּ֣וּ בַ⁠שָּׁמַ֣יִם פִּי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The word the ULT translates as **in the heavens** could be translated as: (1) **in the heavens** as modeled by the ULT in which case the author is describing the role or authority of God by association with the **heavens**. Alternate translation: “They talk with their mouth as if they are God who is in heaven” or “They talk as if they are in the position of God” (2) “against the heavens” in which case the author is describing God by association with the **heavens**. Alternate translation: “They set their mouth against the heavens” or “They set their mouth against God” 
73:9	zxvj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠לְשׁוֹנָ֗⁠ם תִּֽהֲלַ֥ךְ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	The author is speaking of the **tongue** (words or speech) of wicked people as if it could go **through the earth**. What he means is that these wicked people go about talking wickedly (and bragging) as they live their daily lives on **earth** and proudly act as if they are not accountable to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they constantly talk wickedly with their tongues as if they rule the earth” or “and they walk to and fro talking wickedly” 
73:10	ack4			his people turn to them	1	This could mean: (1) “God’s people love the wicked people” or (2) “the wicked people return to this place”
73:10	f9zy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מֵ֥י מָ֝לֵ֗א יִמָּ֥צוּ לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action,  implies that God’s **people** did it. Alternate translation: “and they drain the waters of a full cup” 
73:10	iwws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מֵ֥י מָ֝לֵ֗א יִמָּ֥צוּ לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The author is speaking of **** as if they were ****. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “” 
73:10	k4em			abundant waters are drained out	1	This could mean: (1) “God’s people listen gladly to the words of the wicked people” or (2) “the wicked people have plenty of food to eat and wine to drink”
73:11	k4v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֵיכָ֥ה יָדַֽע־אֵ֑ל וְ⁠יֵ֖שׁ דֵּעָ֣ה בְ⁠עֶלְיֽוֹן	1	The phrase **How does God know** and the phrase **is there knowledge in the Most High** mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if repeating the same idea might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “How does God know?” or “Does God have knowledge?” 
73:11	vf4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠אָמְר֗וּ	1	Here, the word **they** could refer to: (1) wicked people. Alternate translation: “And wicked people say” or “And the wicked say” (2) people who are righteous and obey God. Alternate translation: “And righteous people say” or “And godly people say” 
73:11	iqv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אֵיכָ֥ה יָדַֽע־אֵ֑ל וְ⁠יֵ֖שׁ דֵּעָ֣ה בְ⁠עֶלְיֽוֹן	1	Here, wicked people are not asking for information, but are using the question form to express that they do not think God knows about the evil things they do and/or does not care about the evil things they do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Surely God does not know what we are doing! Surely the Most High has no knowledge of it!” or “Surely God does not care about we are doing! Surely what we are doing does not matter to the Most High!” 
73:11	af0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אֵיכָ֥ה יָדַֽע־אֵ֑ל וְ⁠יֵ֖שׁ דֵּעָ֣ה בְ⁠עֶלְיֽוֹן	1	This portion of this verse is a quotation of what the wicked people said or thought to themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this with quotation marks (as the ULT does) or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.
73:11	kw4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְ⁠עֶלְיֽוֹן	1	Here, **Most High** is a name for God. The ULT indicates that this phrase is a name for God by capitalizing it. Use a natural way in your language to indicate that this is a name or title for God. 
73:12	scy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הִנֵּה	1	The author is using the term **Behold** to focus attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use. Alternate translation: “See” 
73:12	alx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֑ים	1	The Psalmist is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with a noun phrase. See how you translated the phrase **the wicked** in [73:3](../73/03.md). Alternate translation: “wicked ones”  
73:12	neud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠שַׁלְוֵ֥י ע֝וֹלָ֗ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **ease**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as **comfortable** or **or carefree** or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they are always comfortable” or “they are always carefree” 
73:12	xwja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הִשְׂגּוּ־חָֽיִל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wealth**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wealthy” or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they become increasingly wealthy” 
73:13	m4jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אַךְ	1	Here, the author uses the word **Surely** to emphasize his strong thoughts and feelings about the certainty of what he states in the remainder of this verse. Use a natural form in your language for expressing this emphasis. (In [73:1](../73/01.md) the author said that “God is good..to those with a pure heart”  and later in this chapter the author says he was mistaken to think and the way he did in this verse so the word **Surely** does not mean that what follows the word **Surely** in this verse is true. In 73:2-14 the author is expressing his experience and thoughts during a particular period of time. In 73:1 and 73:17-28 the author gives his final conclusion.) Alternate translation: “Certainly” 
73:13	l9bt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	זִכִּ֣יתִי לְבָבִ֑⁠י	1	The author is describing his thoughts and intentions by association with his **heart**, which Jews viewed as the center of a person’s thoughts and intentions. The expression **I have kept my heart clean** means he has intentionally kept his thoughts and intentions morally pure (free from sin). If your readers would not understand this, you could use plain language or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “I have kept my thoughts pure”
73:13	v713		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וָ⁠אֶרְחַ֖ץ בְּ⁠נִקָּי֣וֹן כַּפָּֽ⁠י	1	The author is describing his actions by association with his **hands**, which he would use to do the actions. The author is using the symbolic action of hand washing to declare his **innocence**. In that culture hand washing was a common practice that people did to publicly assert that they were innocent (See Deuteronomy 21:6 and Matthew 27:24). Here, the author is saying that he has **washed** his **hands in innocence** as a way to declare that he is guiltless. See how you translated the similar phrase in [Psalm 26:6](../26/06.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and kept my actions pure to show that I am innocent” or “and kept my actions free from sin”
73:14	gtr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 וָ⁠אֱהִ֣י נָ֭גוּעַ כָּל־הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם וְ֝⁠תוֹכַחְתִּ֗⁠י לַ⁠בְּקָרִֽים	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

The term **rock** is associated with strength here so by calling God the **rock** of his **heart** he means that God is the “strength” of his **heart**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but God, you are like a rock for my heart and you are my portion forever” or “but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever”

74:intro	nd5v				0	# Psalm 074 General Notes\n\n## Type of psalm\n\nPsalm 74 is a psalm of deliverance. The people have been completely conquered and they pray for God to deliver them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/deliverer]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s power\n\nThe enemies have destroyed God’s temple and are insulting the people. God is powerful. He made everything and he chose Israel for his people. He should avenge himself on these enemies that have burnt his temple. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\n### Superscription\n\nThis psalm is called “A Maskil of Asaph.” The word “Maskil” in the original language has caused scholars to have various opinions about its meaning. Some say it means to instruct, while others say that the word is referring to the skill used in creating the psalm. Still others think it means that meditation should be used in reading this psalm.
74:1	k7ui			מַשְׂכִּ֗יל	1	See how you translated the word **Maskil** in [Psalms 32:1](../32/01.md).
74:1	f9ib			מַשְׂכִּ֗יל לְ⁠אָ֫סָ֥ף	1	This phrase is the superscription to this psalm. Format it in the way that you have decided to format all of the superscriptions in the book of Psalms.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST.
74:1	hfgt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לָ⁠מָ֣ה אֱ֭לֹהִים זָנַ֣חְתָּ לָ⁠נֶ֑צַח	1	The author says **forever** here as an overstatement for emphasis.

74:1	ap93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠צֹ֣אן מַרְעִיתֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	The author speaks of God as if he were a shepherd and he speaks about the people of Israel as if they were **sheep** that belong to God (live in his **pasture**).

74:2	hrui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	גָּ֭אַלְתָּ שֵׁ֣בֶט נַחֲלָתֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “your congregation which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance” 
74:2	wcg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֵׁ֣בֶט נַחֲלָתֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Here, the phrase **the tribe of your inheritance** means “the tribe which is your inheritance.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

74:2	jn0z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַר־צִ֝יּ֗וֹן זֶ֤ה ׀ שָׁכַ֬נְתָּ בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	The author is describing the city of Jerusalem, and probably also the temple, by association with Mount Zion. (Mount Zion was located in Jerusalem and was the location of the temple which had been destroyed before the author wrote this psalm.) If your readers would not understand this, you could use plain language as modeled by the UST. 
74:3	vn6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הָרִ֣ימָ⁠ה פְ֭עָמֶי⁠ךָ לְ⁠מַשֻּׁא֣וֹת נֶ֑צַח	1	The author speaks of **God** as if he were a person with **feet** which he could **Lift up** and come and see the ruined temple in Jerusalem. The phrase **Lift up your feet** is probably also indicating that the author wants God to not only take notice of the **ruins** of the Temple but also to take notice quickly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. “Come to the perpetual ruins” or “Come and see the perpetual ruins” or “Please do not delay any longer.

74:3	ueab		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לְ⁠מַשֻּׁא֣וֹת נֶ֑צַח	1	The author says **perpetual** here as an overstatement for emphasis.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “to these seemingly perpetual ruins” or “to these seemingly never-ending ruins” 
74:3	v0e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠קֹּֽדֶשׁ	1	Here, the word **sanctuary** refers to the Temple in Jerusalem that had been destroyed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST.
74:4	df7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שָׁאֲג֣וּ צֹ֭רְרֶי⁠ךָ	1	The author is speaking of God’s **adversaries** as if they were lions that had **roared** in the middle of God’s Temple (meeting place). The phrase **Your adversaries roared** could mean: (1) that God’s **adversaries** spoke or shouted loudly about their victory or with a loud cry of victory. Alternate translation: “Your adversaries have shouted victoriously” (2) That God’s **adversaries** boasted. Alternate translation: “Your adversaries have boasted” or “Your enemies have bragged” 
74:4	tsgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠קֶ֣רֶב מוֹעֲדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Here, the phrase **meeting place** refers to the Temple in Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in the middle of your Temple”

Alternate translation: “they have set up their military banners as signs” or “they have set up their banners as signs” or “they have set up their banners as a sign of their conquest” (2) that God’s **adversaries** had set up items of worship and symbols related to their false religion.

If it would be helpful in your language you could express this meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “They hacked to pieces all the Temple woodwork with their axes”
74:5	vfwx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִ֭וָּדַע כְּ⁠מֵבִ֣יא לְ⁠מָ֑עְלָ⁠ה בִּֽ⁠סֲבָךְ־עֵ֝֗ץ קַרְדֻּמּֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context implies that it was the author or the author and all the Jewish people who saw this event happen who did it. Alternate translation: “When we saw men hacking to pieces the woodwork in the Temple it seemed like those men were like men in the forest who chop down trees with their axes” or “When I saw men hacking to pieces the woodwork in the Temple it seemed as if those men were like men in the forest who chop down trees with their axes””

The author is describing these events as if they were in the process of happening in order to express them in a way that emotionally impacts his readers. Because it is explained throughout this psalm that these events had already happened, you do not need to explain that here unless you choose to put this information in a footnote.
74:6	sqm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פִּתּוּחֶ֣י⁠הָ יָּ֑חַד & יַהֲלֹמֽוּ⁠ן	1	The phrase **its engravings** could refer to (1) the carved wood in the Jerusalem temple that was overlaid with gold.
