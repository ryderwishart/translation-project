front:intro	rm3n				0	# Introduction to Deuteronomy\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Deuteronomy\n\n- Moses’ first speech\n     - Moses reminds Israel of how Yahweh guided them through the wilderness (1:1–3:29)\n     - Moses appeals to Israel to obey the law of Yahweh (4:1–49)\n- Moses’ second speech\n     - The Ten Commandments (5:1–10:22)\n     - Rules and warnings from the Law (11:1–26:19)\n- Moses’ third speech\n     - Instructions for entering Canaan (27:1–26)\n     - Blessings for obeying and curses for disobeying (28:1–68)\n     - The covenant renewed (29:1–30:20)\n     - Last words of Moses, the Song of Moses, and his death (31:1–34:12)\n\n### What is the book of Deuteronomy about?\n\nIn the book of Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the laws of the covenant that God made with the people of Israel. The people of Israel are about to go into the Promised Land. Before they enter the land, Moses reminds them of what Yahweh did for them and what he expects from them. Moses warns the people about worshiping idols and no longer trusting Yahweh once they settle in the Promised Land. Yahweh promises to judge those who disobey him and to bless those who obey his law. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe name “Deuteronomy” means “Second Law” or “the retelling of the Law.” Translators may decide on a title such as “A Repeat of the Law” or “Moses Explains the Law Again.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Deuteronomy?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Deuteronomy. However, many scholars think that Joshua wrote chapter 34, which tells how Moses died.\n\n### What are the important features of the book of Deuteronomy?\n\nThe book contains a series of speeches that Moses gave to Israel before he died. He spoke these things just before the people entered the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why does Yahweh command the Israelites to completely destroy the Canaanite people who live in the Promised Land?\n\nAs God prepares the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commands them to completely destroy the Canaanite people who live there. The Israelites will then not be tempted to join them in worship of their false gods.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What is the role of God’s name in Deuteronomy?\n\nGod’s name is mentioned over 30 times in the book of Deuteronomy. The use of God’s name in this book usually represents God’s honor or fame. At other times in Deuteronomy, God’s name represents his presence. God said he would choose a place and make his name dwell there. This means God’s presence would be there. The people were to go to that place to worship him.\n\n### Can this book be translated before the rest of the Pentateuch?\n\nThe books of Genesis and Exodus help to explain what happens in Deuteronomy. For this reason, those books should be translated before the book of Deuteronomy.\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nSince this book consists of Moses’ speeches, many parts of this book are direct quotations. Within his speeches, Moses directly quotes what others  said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format these passages so that there are not quotations within a quotation. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### “Yahweh your God”\n\nThroughout this book, Moses refers to Yahweh as “your God” when he speaks to the Israelites. Moses is referring to the same God that he also worships. He is not distinguishing between the God of the Israelites and his own God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that this is the same God whom Moses worships. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])\n\n### Moses’ audience\n\nIn his speeches, Moses speaks to the Israelites who will enter into the land that Yahweh promised to give to them. Moses reminds them about events that happened to their ancestors and to them. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state explicitly that Moses is talking about their ancestors even when he directly addresses the living Israelites as “you.” (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])\n\n### “You” singular and plural\n\nAlthough Moses is speaking to all the Israelites, he sometimes addresses them as “you” singular. Moses wants each of the individual Israelites to think about what he is saying. If it would not be natural in your language to address a group with a singular pronoun, you can use the plural “you” when Moses is speaking to all the Israelites. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### “You shall”\nIn this book, the form **you shall** appears often when someone gives a command. While the form itself is not a command, it can be interpreted and translated as a command. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words using a command or instruction form. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])\n\n### “Seed”\n\nThis book refers to a person’s descendants as their “seed.” Seed refers to semen that leads to a child’s conception. All instances of “seed” mean “descendants” unless otherwise specified. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “Listen” and “Keep”\nMoses tells the Israelites to “listen” and “keep” the commandments of Yahweh. He means that they need to carefully obey them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “the land that Yahweh your God is giving you”\n\nMoses refers to the Promised Land as “the land that Yahweh your God is giving you” and “the land that Yahweh your God has given you.” At the time of Moses’ speeches, the Israelites have not yet occupied the land. So, when Moses says that Yahweh **has given** the land to the Israelites, he is reminding the Israelites that Yahweh will keep his promises. The land belongs to the Israelites, they only have to trust Yahweh and take the land.\n(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])
1:intro	ggp9				0	# Deuteronomy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter forms a continuation with the last chapter of the book of Numbers. In this chapter is Moses’ first speech to the Israelites. \n\n- vv. 1-4: Introduction\n- vv. 5-49: Moses reminds the Israelites of what happened to their ancestors in the wilderness\n     - vv. 9-18: Moses chooses judges and military leaders\n     - vv. 19-46: The Israelites send out spies to survey the land \n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Possessing the land\n\nYahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the land of Canaan if they obeyed him. Other people lived in the land, but Yahweh promised to give the Israelites victory over them. The land belongs to Israel, but they have not yet entered it to possess the land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nIn this chapter, Moses gives a speech in which he quotes what others have said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format this passage so that there are no quotations within quotations. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Time Background\n\nIn his speech, Moses reminds the Israelites about what happened to their ancestors when they were camping at Mt. Sinai. Throughout his speech, Moses repeats the phrase “at that time” to refer to new topics that occurred during that time period. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state this information explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevents]])\n
1:1	vb79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ס֜וּף	1	The word **Suph** is the name of a place. It is uncertain where Suph is, but Suph could refer to the Red Sea. Alternate translation: “the Red Sea”
1:1	bg65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	תֹּ֛פֶל וְ⁠לָבָ֥ן וַ⁠חֲצֵרֹ֖ת וְ⁠דִ֥י זָהָֽב	1	These are the names of places.
1:1	mdz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בֵּֽין & וּ⁠בֵֽין	1	Here, the text repeats **between** to describe the relative positions of cities. If it is unnatural in your language to repeat a preposition, you could use a form that identifies an area between cities. Alternate translation: “between … and”
1:2	xcp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַחַ֨ד עָשָׂ֥ר יוֹם֙	1	The implication is that the journey takes **11 days**. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is a journey of 11 days”
1:3	xm9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִי֙	1	Moses is using the word translated **And it happened** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “And it came to pass” 
1:3	pc9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה בְּ⁠עַשְׁתֵּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ר חֹ֖דֶשׁ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use cardinal numbers here or equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “after 40 years, in month 11”
1:3	zfn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתֵּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ר חֹ֖דֶשׁ	1	The **eleventh** month of the Hebrew calendar includes January on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may wish instead to give just the number of the day and the name of the Hebrew month in the text of your translation and indicate in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.
1:3	c54r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֣י	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, the author is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “the children of”
1:3	e9a7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” Moses is identifying the Israelites as descendants of their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “the people of Israel”
1:4	xfh0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַכֹּת֗⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Yahweh caused the Israelites to defeat Sihon and Og under Moses' command. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Yahweh caused the Israelites to defeat”
1:4	fivx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַכֹּת֗⁠וֹ	1	Here, the pronoun **he** refers back to Moses in verse 3. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “Moses defeated”
1:4	mpn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתָּרֹ֖ת בְּ⁠אֶדְרֶֽעִי	1	The words **Ashtaroth** and **Edrei** are the names of cities.
1:4	e5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתָּרֹ֖ת בְּ⁠אֶדְרֶֽעִי	1	The implication is that King Og ruled over both **Ashtaroth** and **Edrei**. **Ashtaroth** and **Edrei** were cities that were close to each other. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in Ashtaroth and in Edrei”
1:5	juo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	Here, the word **saying** introduces direct speech. Consider natural ways of doing that in your own language.

Alternate translation: “Moses began explaining the law that Yahweh God had spoken to his people at Horeb. He said,”
1:6	s8em		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אֵלֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1	Moses is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and every Israelite who was an adult when they were at Horeb, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: “to me and to your family members” 
1:7	l6np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פְּנ֣וּ ׀ וּ⁠סְע֣וּ לָ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the word **Turn** describes the beginning of action. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Start your journey”
1:7	cwjt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וּ⁠סְע֣וּ לָ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	The expression **and journey yourselves** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “and journey”
1:7	cqqw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׁכֵנָי⁠ו֒	1	Here, **neighbors** refers to any people groups in the nearby areas. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people groups near them”

1:8	tgax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Here, **faces** represent the presence of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “before you”
1:8	p2mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	נִשְׁבַּ֣ע יְ֠הוָה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If this would not be natural in your language, you could use the first person form. Alternate translation: “I swore”
1:8	pcv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ⁠אֲבֹ֨תֵי⁠כֶ֜ם	1	Yahweh is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your predecessors”
1:9	dv93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר	1	Here, **I** refers back to Moses in verse 5. If it would be helpful in your language, you could repeat the name “Moses” here. Alternate translation: “I, Moses, said”

1:10	x7q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	When Moses says **your God**, he is referring to the same God whom he also worships.

You could express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language.

The first relationship involves two Israelites. The second relationship involves an Israelite and a non-Israelite.

2:intro	ji46				0	# Deuteronomy 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues Moses’ first speech from the previous chapter.\n\n- vv. 1-11: Moses recounts the Israelites’ journey from the wilderness to the land of the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites\n- vv. 24-37: Moses recounts how Yahweh allowed the Israelites to defeat King Sihon\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Possessing the land\n\nYahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the land of Canaan if they obeyed him. Other peoples lived in the land, but Yahweh promised to give the Israelites victory over them. The land belongs to Israel, but they have not yet entered it to possess the land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]]\n\n\n)## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nIn this chapter, Moses gives a speech and quotes what others said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format this passage so that there are no quotations within a quotation. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Moses represents the Israelites\n\nThe singular pronoun “you” occurs when Yahweh speaks directly to Moses. The Israelites request that Moses speak to Yahweh on their behalf because the Israelites fear Yahweh and do not want to speak directly to him. Moses acts as a representative on behalf of all the Israelites. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could clarify that Yahweh wants Moses to tell the Israelites everything that Yahweh says.\n\n### Raphaites\n\nVerses 11 and 20 refer to a group of people called the Raphaites. The term “Raphaites” is a variation of the term “Rephaites” or “Rephaim.” These terms all refer to the Rapha people group. Use a form in your language that is a natural way to refer to a people group. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Background information\n\nThe writer of Deuteronomy adds background information to help readers understand the historical context of Moses’ speech. In the ULT, this information is enclosed in parentheses. Use a method that is natural in your language for indicating that a section of text is background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

3:intro	z1ea				0	# Deuteronomy 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues Moses’ speech that began in Chapter 1.\n\n- vv. 1-11: Moses recounts how the Israelites defeated King Og\n- vv. 12-22: Moses allots land east of the Jordan to Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh\n- vv. 23-29: Yahweh forbids Moses from entering the land\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Possessing the land\n\nYahweh promised the Israelites that he will give them the land of Canaan if they obey him. Other people groups live in the land, but Yahweh promises to give the Israelites victory over them. The land belongs to Israel, but they have not yet entered it to possess the land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]]\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties\n\n### “You”\nWhen Moses is referring to the Israelites, he uses the plural forms of “you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])### Quotes in quotes\n\nIn this chapter, Moses gives a speech and quotes what others said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format this passage so that there are no quotations within a quotation. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Time Background\n\nIn his speech, Moses reminds the Israelites about what happened to their ancestors before they entered the land that Yahweh promised to give to them. Throughout his speech, Moses repeats the phrase “at that time” to refer to events that occurred during that time period. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state this information explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevents]])

4:intro	d8g8				0	# Deuteronomy 4 General Notes\n\n## Chapter Outline\n- vv. 1-40: Moses encourages the Israelites to obey Yahweh\n- vv. 41-43: Moses appoints cities of refuge\n- vv. 44-49: Summary of Moses’ first speech\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Moses’ instructions\nGod will not allow Moses to enter into the Promised Land. Since the Israelites are getting ready to possess the Promised Land, Moses gives them some last instructions before his death. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### Cities of Refuge\n\nVerses 41-43 discuss cities of refuge, which are towns to which a manslayer could flee. In this case, a manslayer is anyone who accidentally kills another person. In those times, a close family member of the deceased would be obligated to take revenge for the killing of his family member by finding and killing the manslayer. Yahweh provides protection for the manslayer so that they will not be punished too harshly. \n(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/refuge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\n### Likeness\nVerses 15-31 warn the Israelites against creating idols. The other people groups in the land worshiped entities in nature such as the sun, moon, stars, trees, and so on. They created idols that looked like (in the likeness of) these entities. Yahweh forbids the Israelites from making likenesses of anything for the purpose of worshiping it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/likeness]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nMoses uses several rhetorical questions in verses 7-8, and 33-34. The purpose of these questions is to convince his readers to obey his instructions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Words for the law\n- statutes\n- ordinances\n- judgments\nMoses uses several words to refer to the law that Yahweh commanded the Israelites to obey. It is unclear what the differences are between these terms. If your language has different terms for the law, you could use them here to differentiate between the different Hebrew words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### “You”\n\n\n- vv. 1-22: “You” and “your” are both singular and plural; see notes for details.\n- vv. 23-40: “you” and “your” are singular.\n\nMoses is speaking to the Israelites who are alive, but he refers to events that happened to their ancestors. The pronouns “you” or “your” are plural here unless otherwise noted. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could explicitly state that these events happened to their ancestors. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n

5:intro	xsp1				0	# Deuteronomy 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- vv.1-4: Moses reminds the Israelites that Yahweh made a covenant with them on Mount Sinai\n- vv. 5-21: Moses repeats the Ten Commandments\n- vv. 22-33: Moses reminds the Israelites that he spoke to Yahweh on their behalf because they feared Yahweh\n\nSome translations set each of the commandments in the list of Ten Commandments in 5:7–21 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT uses a separate paragraph for each commandment.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Ten Commandments\n\nThis chapter repeats the words from Exodus 20, which are known as the Ten Commandments. It is important for the Israelites to obey these words as part of their covenant with Yahweh. Yahweh gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai after the Israelites left Egypt. The Ten Commandments are written on two stone tablets that are placed in the ark of the covenant. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tencommandments]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/arkofthecovenant]]) \n\n\n### The Sabbath\nYahweh commands the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, known as the Sabbath. The rest reminds the Israelites that Yahweh rested on the seventh day of creation. The Sabbath also reminds the Israelites that they have rest because Yahweh rescued them from being slaves in Egypt, where they had no rest. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Other Translation Issues\n\n### “You”\n\nWhen Moses is addressing the Israelites, he uses both the singular and plural forms of “You.”\n\n- vv. 1-5: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- vv. 8-21: “You” and “your” are singular.\n- vv. 22-24: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- vv. 28: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- vv. 32-33: “You” and “your” are plural.\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words.

6:intro	q4y8				0	# Deuteronomy 6 General Notes\n\n## Outline\n- vv. 1-9: The great commandment\n- vv. 6-25: Warnings against disobedience\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s blessings\nYahweh’s continued blessing of the people of Israel is dependent upon the people’s obedience to the law of Moses. When the Israelites agreed to the covenant with Yahweh, they acknowledged that worshiping and obeying Yahweh would lead to blessings, while disobeying him and worshiping other gods would lead to curses. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### The Shema\nVerses 6-9 are known as the Shema in Judaism. They are an important foundation of Judaism. In [Mark 12:28-29](Mrk/12/28.md), Jesus identifies the Shema as the greatest commandment.\n\n### Writing Yahweh’s Words on One’s Arms, Forehead, and Doorposts\n\n[Verses 8-9](../06/08.md) command the Israelites always to remember Yahweh’s words. There are different understandings of these commands. Some Jewish traditions interpret these verses as meaning the Israelites should physically write copies of the law. Others believe that the command is to memorize and cherish the law. Translators should be careful to translate the passage as it is, without favoring one interpretation or the other in their translation.\n\n## Other Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Words for "the law"\n- statutes\n- ordinances\n- judgments\nMoses uses three different words to refer to the law that Yahweh commanded the Israelites to obey. It is unclear what distinguishes each of these terms from the others. If your language has several terms for the law, you could use them here to differentiate between the various Hebrew words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n

7:intro	y1wn				0	# Deuteronomy 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n- vv. 1-11: Moses reminds the Israelites that they belong to Yahweh because of their covenant with him.\n- vv. 12-26: Blessings for obedience\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “You must completely destroy them”\nThe people of Canaan worshiped idols and did other things that were abominations to Yahweh. Since the Israelites had a special relationship with Yahweh, Yahweh used Israel to punish these nations for their idolatry by destroying them completely. Yahweh wanted the Israelites to live differently than those nations. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])\n\n### Abrahamic Covenant\n\nThis chapter references parts of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham. Yahweh promised Abraham that he would have very many descendants. The Israelites are the descendants of Abraham, so Yahweh repeats his promise to them in Deuteronomy, telling them that they will prosper and increase their population if they obey him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n\n## Other Potential Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n

In the wilderness, the Israelites complained and grumbled. It was easy for them to forget what Yahweh did for them and disobey Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh punished that generation by causing them to die in the wilderness without entering the land. The living Israelites are the children of that generation. Moses is warning them not to make the same mistakes as their parents did. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/Israel]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nWhen Moses is addressing the Israelites, he uses both the singular and plural forms of “You.”\n\n- vv. 1: See notes.\n- vv. 2-19: “You” and “your” are singular.\n- vv. 20: “you” and “your” are plural.\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

The Israelites will not be strong enough on their own to conquer these other nations. This victory will be Yahweh’s. The people did not earn this victory, but it is Yahweh’s punishment of these sinful nations. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Israel’s sin\nYahweh is about to punish the Canaanites for their sin. He also reminds Israel of their sin. This serves as a warning to the people of Israel. If they sin again, Yahweh will punish them too.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nWhen Moses is addressing the Israelites, he uses both the singular and plural forms of “you.”\n\n- vv. 1-6: “You” and “your” are singular.\n- vv. 7: See note.\n- vv. 8-9:  “You” and “your” are plural.\n- vv. 16-25: “You” and “your” are plural.\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

Others believe that the command is to memorize and cherish the law. Translators should be careful to translate the passage as it is, without implying one interpretation or the other in their translation.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nWhen Moses is addressing the Israelites, he uses both the singular and plural forms of “you.”\n\n- v. 1:  “You” and “your” are singular.\n- vv. 2-9: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- v. 10: See note.\n- vv. 11-13: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- vv. 14-15:  “You” and “your” are singular.\n- vv. 16-18: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- vv. 19-20: See notes.\n- vv. 21-28: “You” and “your” are plural.\n- v. 29: “You” and “your” are singular.\n- vv. 31-32: “You” and “your” are plural.\n\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

12:intro	mt76				0	# Deuteronomy 12 General Notes\n\n\n## Outline\n- vv. 1-28: Yahweh will choose one place for worship in the land\n- vv. 29-32: Warnings against idolatry\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Covenant with Moses\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. The reasons for these food restrictions are not always known.(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Israel and Yahweh\n\nIn the ancient Near East, when nations conquered other nations, they often added the gods of the conquered nation into the collection of gods they worshiped. It was rare to worship only one God. Israel was to be known for worshiping Yahweh and Yahweh alone. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Words for the Law\n\n- statutes\n- ordinances\n- judgments\nMoses uses several words to refer to the law that Yahweh commanded the Israelites to obey. It is unclear what the differences are between these terms. If your language has different terms for the law, you could use them here to differentiate between the different Hebrew words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### “You”\n\nVerses 1-12: You is plural unless otherwise noted.\nVerses 13-32: You is singular\nMoses wants each individual to obey the law for themselves.\n\n### “The Place Yahweh your God will choose”\n\nMoses refers to the future place where the temple will be built as “the place Yahweh your God will choose for his name to dwell there” or “the place Yahweh your God will choose it.” These phrases emphasize that Yahweh decides how and where the Israelites must worship him. The wording of these phrases might be unnatural in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “the place Yahweh your God will set his name” or “the place Yahweh your God will choose”\n(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])

12:8	pn42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אִ֖ישׁ	1	The word **man** represents all people in general, not one particular man.

13:intro	e2ze				0	# Deuteronomy 13 General Notes\n\n\nThis chapter continues Moses’ second speech, which began in [Chapter 5](../05/01.md). \n\n## Chapter 13 Outline\n- vv. 1-11: Execute idol worshipers\n- vv. 12-18: Destroy cities where idol worshipers live\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### False prophecy\n\nVerses 1-11 discuss false prophets and people who practice divination. These are people who claim that their message comes from Yahweh, but they encourage people to worship idols instead of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/false-prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/divination]])\n\n### Abominations\n\nAnything that is sinful or ceremonially impure according to the law is called an **abomination** in this chapter. The sinful things include people who worship idols, items used for idol worship, and anything associated with idolatry. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/detest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wicked]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nEven though Moses is speaking to all of the Israelites, **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could use the plural forms in your translation. \n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### Hypothetical conditions\n\nMoses is addressing situations that could occur in the future and giving instructions for the Israelites to follow if those situations occur. In your translation, be sure to use phrases that show that Moses is talking about hypothetical situations, not promising that something will happen in the future. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
13:1	v8gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	כִּֽי	1	Moses is using the word **If** to introduce a hypothetical condition as a warning against idolatry. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a situation that could happen. Alternate translation: “Should it happen that”

14:intro	epl7				0	# Deuteronomy 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues Moses’ second speech, which began in Chapter 4.\n\n- vv. 1-2: Commands for mourning practices\n- vv. 3-10: Clean and unclean creatures\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Law of Moses\n\nThis chapter is part of the law of Moses, which is part of the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. Yahweh will enable the Israelites to live on the land if they obey his commands. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Clean animals\n\nThere are animals which the law considered to be clean and unclean. The people were not allowed to eat the unclean animals. Scholars are uncertain about the reasons for the animals to be considered to be clean or unclean. The result of these food restrictions was a nation that was different than the nations surrounding it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])\n\n## Other Potential Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nMoses is speaking to all the Israelites, so all forms of the second person pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this chapter unless otherwise specified. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])\n\n### Types of living creatures\n\nThis chapter discusses which living creatures are permissible for the Israelites to eat. It is unclear which specific creatures some of the Hebrew terms refer to, but the general categories of these creatures are explained in the notes. Additionally, your readers may not be familiar with many of these creatures. In your translation, you could use broad categories of animals, such as fish, birds of prey, and cattle. Or, you could use the names of similar creatures in your area as the ones mentioned in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### “The Place Yahweh your God will choose”\r\n\r\nMoses refers to the future place where the temple will be built as “the place Yahweh your God will choose for his name to dwell there” or “the place Yahweh your God will choose it.” These phrases emphasize that Yahweh decides how and where the Israelites must worship him. The wording of these phrases might be unnatural in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “the place Yahweh your God will set his name” or “the place Yahweh your God will choose”\r\n(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])

15:intro	n3mh				0	# Deuteronomy 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter continues Moses’ second speech that began in chapter 4.\n\n- vv. 1-11: Rules for canceling debts every 7 years\n- vv. 12-18: Rules for fellow Israelite slaves\n- vv. 19-23: Rules for firstborn male livestock\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Israelite slaves\n\nThis chapter contains rules for owning slaves that were fellow Israelites. An Israelite might work as another Israelite’s slave to pay off debt. Instead of receiving pay, their wages would go toward their debt. The debtor would be their creditor’s property, and they could not work elsewhere. If the word “slave” would not accurately describe this practice in your culture, you could use a comparable term, such as “indentured servant” or “bondservant.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/servant]])\n\n## Other possible translation issues in this chapter\n\n### “You”\nWhen Moses refers to the Israelites, he uses both singular and plural forms of “you.” \n- vv. 1- : “You” is singular.\nUse pronouns that would be natural in your language for referring to a group of people.

The Passover feast represents the time when the Israelites escaped from Egypt. There are several other important festivals described in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n\n## Other Potential Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nWhen Moses is addressing the Israelites, he uses the singular forms of “you” in this chapter. If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### “The Place Yahweh your God will choose”\n\nMoses refers to the future place where the temple will be built as “the place Yahweh your God will choose for his name to dwell there” or “the place Yahweh your God will choose it.” These phrases emphasize that Yahweh decides how and where the Israelites must worship him. The wording of these phrases might be unnatural in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression.

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.

17:intro	a3z4				0	# Deuteronomy 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n### Outline\n- v. 1: More instructions for animals for sacrifice\n- vv. 2-7: Punishments for people who worship idols\n- vv. 8-13: Instructions for difficult legal cases\n- vv. 14-20: Instructions for kings\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Witnesses\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common for a person to be punished by the testimony of a single person, especially if this was an important person. The rules in this chapter give protection to people, especially the poor by requiring multiple witnesses. This allowed justice to be done. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])\n\n### King\n\nIsrael was not to have a king because Yahweh was their king. Knowing the sinfulness of the people, Yahweh anticipated that one day Israel would have a king. Therefore, this passage gives commands about their king prophetically. They were not allowed to collect chariots because they were a sign of earthly power and the king was to trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “You”\n\nWhen Moses is addressing the Israelites, he uses the singular forms of, “you” and “your.” If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### Generic nouns used in hypothetical conditions\n\nVerses 2-13 give examples of sins that an Israelite might commit when they live the land and instructions for deciding what should happen. In these hypothetical conditions, singular nouns like “man,” “woman,” and “judge” represent those groups of people in general, not a specific man or woman whom Moses is predicting will commit a sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that these terms refer to any person who fulfills the hypothetical situation.

19:intro	r53s				0	# Deuteronomy 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n### Outline\n- vv. 1-13: Cities of refuge\n- v. 14: Property lines\n- vv. 15-21: Rules against bearing false witness\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Witnesses\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common for a person to be punished by the testimony of a single person, especially if this was an important person. The rules in this chapter give protection to people, especially the poor by requiring multiple witnesses. This allowed justice to be done. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\n### Cities of Refuge\n\nVerses 1-13 discuss cities of refuge, which are towns to which a killer could flee. These verses address both cases where the killer accidentally kills another person, and cases where the killer plans the murder. In those times, a close family member of the deceased would be obligated to take revenge for the killing of his family member by finding and killing the manslayer. Yahweh provides protection for the killer who killed accidentally so that he will not be punished too harshly.\n(See: [[rc:///tw/dict/bible/other/refuge]] and [[rc:///tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Law of retaliation\n\nThe chapter describes a famous law, often called the “law of retaliation.” It is said, an “eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” This does not mean a person who causes another person to lose their eye must have their own eye removed as punishment. This law is not about making all things equal. Instead, it is about limiting the punishment or the ability of a person to retaliate. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Generic Nouns in Hypothetical Situations\nThis chapter gives instructions and warnings for the Israelites. In these hypothetical conditions, singular nouns like “man,” “witness,” and “neighbor” represent those groups of people in general, not a specific person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that these terms refer to any person who fulfills the hypothetical situation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

20:intro	qq8m				0	# Deuteronomy 20 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s protection\nIsrael was not to worry about the power and strength of other nations. Instead, they were to trust in the power of Yahweh. He is the source of their military strength and protection. This is why a priest leads them into battle, rather than a military commander. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n\n### Holy war\n\nIsrael’s conquering of the Promised Land was unique in history. It was a type of holy war and had special rules. This war was really Yahweh’s punishment against the sin of the Canaanite people. If the people were not completely destroyed, they would cause Israel to sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### “What man is there”\nThis phrase is used several times to introduce a rhetorical question. The questions are intended to tell the readers that Yahweh only wants soldiers who are completely dedicated to fighting for him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Excused from fighting\n\nIn ancient Israel, men were excused from fighting in battle for several different reasons. Some of these reasons are mentioned in this chapter. Apparently, needing to establish a new house, the need to harvest a field and cowardice were possible excuses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
