Solomon reigns (3:1–11:43)\n    * Solomon becomes wise and wealthy (3:1–4:43)\n    * Solomon’s temple (5:1–8:66)\n    * Rise and fall of Solomon (9:1–11:43)\n1. The kingdom divides (12:1–14:31)\n    * Rehoboam succeeds Solomon (12:1–24)\n    * Jeroboam rules the northern kingdom of Israel (12:25–33)\n    * Ahijah prophesies against Jeroboam (13:1–14:20)\n    * Rehoboam’s end (14:21–31)\n1. Kings and events in Israel and Judah (15:1–22:53)\n    * Abijah and Asa in Judah (15:1–24)\n    * Nadab in Israel (15:25–32)\n    * Baasha in Israel (15:33–16:7)\n    * Elah in Israel (16:8–14)\n    * Zimri in Israel (16:15–22)\n    * Omri in Israel (16:23–28)\n    * Ahab in Israel (16:29–22:40)\n    * Jehoshaphat in Judah (22:41–50)\n    * Ahaziah in Israel (22:51–53)\n\n### What are the Books of 1 and 2 Kings about?\n\nThese books are about what happened to the people of Israel, from the time of King Solomon to the time both the northern and southern kingdoms were destroyed. These books describe how Israel split into two kingdoms after Solomon died. It also tells about all the kings that ruled over each kingdom after Solomon died.\n\nIn the southern kingdom, some kings did what Yahweh judged to be right. For example, King Josiah repaired the temple and reformed the worship of Yahweh. He responded to the high priest finding a copy of the Law of Yahweh in Jerusalem ([2 Kings 22–23](../../2ki/22/01.md)). However, all of the kings of the northern kingdom were wicked.\n\nThe Assyrians destroyed the northern kingdom in 722 B.C. The Babylonians destroyed the southern kingdom in 586 B.C.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe Books of 1 and 2 Kings were originally one book in Hebrew. They were separated into two books when translated into Greek. Translators might choose more meaningful titles such as “The First Book about the Kings” and “The Second Book about the Kings.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the purpose of 1 and 2 Kings?\n\nThese books were probably finished during the exile, after the Babylonians had destroyed the temple. They show how being faithful to Yahweh results in his blessing and prospering his people. Worshipping idols and not being faithful result in their being punished and destroyed.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Why do the Books of 1 and 2 Kings refer to someone being addressed indirectly?\n\nIn the Bible, people often referred to themselves as “your servant” when speaking to anyone in a superior position to themselves. Indirectly addressing people in this way was intended to honor the one addressed. English sometimes uses the address “sir” in this way. But a translator should use whatever expressions that are natural in the project language in order to honor someone in a superior position.\n\n### What does the king “did what was right (or evil) in the eyes of Yahweh” mean?\n\nThe writer repeats this kind of expression throughout the Books of 1 and 2 Kings. Here “in the eyes of Yahweh” represents what Yahweh thinks about someone. If a king was faithful and obeyed the covenant, he did what was right according to Yahweh. If he was not faithful and disobeyed the covenant, he did what was evil according to Yahweh.\n\n### What is the meaning of the term “Israel”?\n\nThe name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])\n\n### Can I translate the Book of 1 Kings before I translate the Books of 1 and 2 Samuel?\n\nThe Books of 1 and 2 Samuel should be translated before 1 Kings, since 1 Kings continues from where 2 Samuel ends.
1:intro	v496				0	# 1 Kings 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. David dies and Solomon begins to reign (1:1–2:46)\n      * Abishag begins to take care of King David (1:1–4)\n      * Adonijah claims to be the next king (1:5–10)\n      * Nathan advises Bathsheba on how to respond (1:11–14)\n      * Bathsheba and Nathan inform King David about Adonijah (1:15–27)\n      * King David responds by appointing Solomon as the next king (1:28–37)\n      * Solomon is proclaimed as the next king (1:38–40)\n      * Jonathan informs Adonijah, Joab, and the people with them about Solomon (1:41–48)\n      * Solomon has mercy on Adonijah (1:49–53)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The next king\n\nIt was customary in this culture for a king, when he became old or died, to be succeeded as king by one of his sons. King David had many sons with many different wives, and he had not indicated which son would be king after him. So, Adonijah, one of the oldest sons, decided that he wanted to be king. He invited many important people to a feast, and they all agreed that he should be the next king. However, some other important people went to King David and asked him to make Solomon, one of Adonijah’s younger brothers, the next king. When David agreed to do this, everyone who agreed that Adonijah should be the next king ran away and no longer supported him. Be sure that your readers understand that the narrative of this chapter is about who will be the next king after King David.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Symbolic actions\n\nIn this chapter, people perform several different kinds of actions that had special significance in their culture. When someone sits on a throne, it indicates that this person has power and authority. When people bow or prostrate themselves before someone else, it indicates that they are honoring and giving respect to that person. When someone is anointed with oil, it indicates that this person is being commissioned to accomplish a specific task or fill a specific role. If the significance of these actions would be misunderstood in your culture, you state their meaning explicitly in your translation. See the notes on the verses that describe these actions for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in conversations with individual people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Exalting oneself\n\nExalting oneself can lead to disaster as when Adonijah made himself king. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/exalt]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Euphemism\n\nDavid spoke of his impending death using a euphemism: “I am going the way of all the earth.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nDavid wanted to emphasize the importance of obeying God to his son Solomon. He used parallelism, saying the same thing seven times using different words: “Keep the commands of Yahweh your God to walk in his ways, to obey his statutes, his commandments, his decisions, and his covenant decrees, being careful to do what is written in the law of Moses.” Some languages have other ways of emphasizing an idea.

3:intro	r15u				0	# 1 Kings 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter has two stories. Verses 1–15 is the story of Solomon’s dream when God asked him what he wanted and he said he needed wisdom to be a good and fair ruler. Verses 16–28 is the story of a court case showing Solomon’s wisdom. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wisdom\n\nGod was very pleased with Solomon’s request for wisdom. This is because wisdom was something that he could use to serve other people instead of himself. Because this was a noble request, God promised Solomon wisdom, wealth, and fame. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])\n\n### Putting the needs of others first\n\nThere are two additional examples of people putting the needs of others in front of their own needs. God is pleased with people wanting to do their job well more than wanting to be blessed. A mother will put the life of her child above every other concern. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])

It is the last chapter about the building of the temple. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Bronze\n\nSolomon hired a man from Tyre who was good at casting things out of bronze. The bronze objects were made by hollowing out the shape of the object in clay and then pouring in the hot melted liquid bronze and letting it cool. He made two large pillars and a large water reservoir set on the backs of 12 bronze cows. He made all the instruments for use in the sacrifices outside the temple. He made the furnishing inside the temple out of gold.\n\n### The temple and the palace\n\nSolomon spent 13 years building a palace for himself that was much bigger than the temple. It is significant that the house of Solomon was much larger than the house of God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/houseofgod]])

12:intro	abcc				0	# 1 Kings 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Civil war\n\nThis chapter explains how the united kingdom of Israel was split into the two kingdoms: Israel and Judah. This is sometimes called a “civil war.”\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Israel splits\n\nGod’s warning to Solomon came true. In spite of his famous wealth, Solomon had over-taxed his own people and forced them to work for free. When the people requested that King Rehoboam reduce taxes and forced labor, he said that he would be harsher than his father. This caused the 10 northern tribes to revolt and appoint Jeroboam as their king. These northern tribes are now called the kingdom of Israel. Only Judah and Benjamin stayed with Rehoboam. They are called Judah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/appoint]])\n\n### Jeroboam introduces calf worship\n\nJeroboam made a terrible mistake. He was afraid that if the people continued to go to Jerusalem to worship in the temple, they would want to return to Rehoboam as their king. So he made two shrines with calves made of gold for the people to worship. This eventually caused the destruction of his whole family. The kingdom of Israel continued worshiping the idols until they were taken slaves by the Assyrians. The northern tribes were unable to truly worship Yahweh without going to Jerusalem in the kingdom of Judah.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nThe people used the metaphor of “yoke” for oppressive government: “Your father made our yoke difficult. Now then, make your father’s hard work easier, and lighten the heavy yoke that he put on us.” But Rehoboam promised to increase their oppression with three metaphors: “My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke.

The other is the reign of Rehoboam (20–31).\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The death of Jeroboam’s son\nGod knows the truth; it is useless to try to fool God’s prophet. Jeroboam’s son became sick; so the king sent his wife, disguised as a common woman, to the prophet. The prophet was blind, but when Jeroboam’s wife arrived he told her, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam.” He also told her that her son would die and that all of Jeroboam’s family would be killed, because he had caused Israel to worship the golden calves. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/true]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Rehoboam’s reign\nWhen Solomon obeyed God, God made him very rich. When the people of Judah began to worship the fertility goddess, Ashtoreth, and to do many evil things, they had to give all of their wealth to the king of Egypt to persuade him not to attack Jerusalem.

Elijah went to meet Ahab. He told Ahab to bring the 450 prophets of Baal and all the people to Mount Carmel. Then he proposed an experiment, which was carried out. The prophets of Baal took one bull, killed them, cut them up, and placed them on wood on an altar without lighting the fire. The prophets of Baal danced and prayed to Baal all morning and half the afternoon. After they were exhausted, Elijah built his altar and drenched it with water. Then he prayed. God answered his prayer with fire that burned up the sacrifice, the altar and the water. Then Elijah told the people to seize the prophets of Baal and kill them. After that, Elijah prayed for rain, and it rained very hard. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Humor\n\nElijah insults the false god Baal. He states, “Perhaps he is thinking, or is relieving himself, or he is traveling on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.” Baal was too busy in the bathroom to answer the prophets. “Relieving himself” is a euphemism.
