**Thank you so much for submitting a suggested change.**

We ask that you title the issue with the Book, Chapter and Verse information. You can write out the book name or use the 3-letter code. For example you will type in the Title field above:

```markdown
Matthew 5:6
```

OR

```markdown
MAT 5:6
```

Will you please start your suggestion with a copy of the current text and then put 2 blank lines and then your suggested change below that.

For example:


```markdown
Who was the chief commander of Saul’s army? (this is the text of the tW page)

Who was the **head leader** of Saul’s army? (this is a suggested change - with the suggestion in bold)
```

**We really appreciate your help in making the resources the best they can be!**
