Encouragement and instructions to show hospitality (1:2–8)\n3. Condemnation of Diotrephes (1:9–10)\n4. Instructions to imitate what is good (1:11)\n5. Praise for Demetrius (1:12)\n6. Conclusion and greetings (1:13–15)\n\n### Who wrote the book of 3 John?\n\nThe letter does not give the name of the author. The author only identified himself as **The elder** (1:1). The letter was probably written by the apostle John near the end of his life, after he had written the Gospel of John and the letters 1 John and 2 John.\n\n### What is the book of 3 John about?\n\nJohn wrote this letter to a believer named Gaius. He instructed Gaius to be hospitable and helpful to fellow believers who were traveling through his area. These were probably groups of traveling Christian preachers and teachers. John also warned Gaius about a bad leader in the church there named Diotrephes and commended a good leader there named Demetrius.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “3 John” or “Third John.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Third Letter from John” or “The Third Letter John Wrote”. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is hospitality?\n\nHospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discouraged Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers. In 3 John, John encouraged Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How does the author use family relationships in his letter?\n\nThe author used the terms **brother** and **children** in a way that can be confusing. The Old Testament scriptures often used the term **brothers** to refer to fellow Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to fellow Christians. Also, John called some believers his **children**. He meant this in a spiritual sense; these were believers whom he had taught to obey Christ.\n\nJohn also used the term **Gentile** in a way that could be confusing. The scriptures often used the term **Gentile** to refer to people who are not Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to those who did not believe in Jesus.\n\n### Which form of “you” occurs in this letter?\n\nThis is a personal letter from John to his friend Gaius. All instances of **you** and **your** in this letter refer to Gaius and are singular.\n\n### How can I translate verses 6-7 in a logical order?\n\nVerse 7 provides the reason for the action that John recommends in verse 6. In some languages, it is more natural to state the reason first, and the action afterwards. If this would be more natural in your language, you can reverse the order of the sentences and then combine the verse numbers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]]) \n\n\nFor the ULT, reversing the sentences would look like this:\n\n6-7\nthe ones having borne witness to your love in the presence of the church. These people went out for the sake of the name, receiving nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, you will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of God.
1:1	w99t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ πρεσβύτερος	1	**The elder** refers to John, the apostle and disciple of Jesus. He refers to himself as the **elder** either because of his old age or because he is a leader in the church or both, since both were true. If possible, use a word in your language that can refer to both old age and church leadership. If it would be helpful in your language, the name of the author can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “I, John the elder, am writing”
1:1	lls6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Γαΐῳ	1	**Gaius** is a man, a fellow believer to whom John is writing this letter.
1:1	kpbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὃν ἐγὼ ἀγαπῶ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “whom I love sincerely”
1:2	i269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	καθὼς εὐοδοῦταί σου ἡ ψυχή	1	John is using one part of Gaius, his **soul**, to mean all of him in a spiritual perspective.

1:3	f6yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	The word translated as **For** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before.

1:3	b4zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐρχομένων ἀδελφῶν	1	John is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith.

1:3	mexh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ μαρτυρούντων 	1	John assumes that Gaius will understand that **the brothers** who came were the ones **testifying** about Gaius.

1:3	k1jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀληθείᾳ & ἀληθείᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way, as in the UST. 
1:4	c375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μειζοτέραν & οὐκ ἔχω χαράν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Nothing makes me more joyful than” or “Nothing makes me happier than”
1:4	w79m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ ἐμὰ τέκνα	1	John speaks of those whom he taught to believe in Jesus as though they were his **children**. This also emphasizes his love and concern for them. Alternate translation: “my spiritual children”
1:4	hsgh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ περιπατοῦντα	1	Here, **walking** on a path is a metaphor for how a person lives his life. Alternate translation: “are living according to God’s truth”

1:5	tmh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀγαπητέ	1	The word **Beloved** refers to Gaius. John is using it as a term of endearment for Gaius as a fellow believer. Use a term here for a dear friend in your language.
1:5	gs6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πιστὸν ποιεῖς	1	The implication is that Gaius is being faithful to God. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you are doing what is faithful to God” or “you are being loyal to God”

1:6	wzf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	οἳ ἐμαρτύρησάν σου τῇ ἀγάπῃ ἐνώπιον ἐκκλησίας	1	Here, **the ones** refers back to the “strangers” in verse 5. If it would be helpful in your language, you could repeat the word “strangers” here. Alternate translation: “those who were strangers to you, who have told the believers in the church here about how you have loved them”
1:6	pb64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	οὓς	1	Here, **them** may refer (1) in a general sense to all traveling believers, rather than to the specific strangers who told about how Gaius had helped them. Alternate translation: “all such travelers” (2) to the specific group of travelers who told about how Gaius had helped them. In this case, the same group would be traveling back to where Gaius is and then traveling farther. Alternate translation: “these brothers”  
1:6	uln9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὓς & προπέμψας	1	John is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “to send them on their journey”
1:6	vaxw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὓς & προπέμψας	1	Here, **send them on** is an idiom that means “give them what they need for the journey.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to supply them for the trip” 
1:6-7	jfun		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὓς καλῶς ποιήσεις, προπέμψας ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ; ὑπὲρ γὰρ τοῦ ὀνόματος ἐξῆλθον, μηδὲν λαμβάνοντες ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνικῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. If you do so, you will need to combine verses 6 and 7 as described in the [book introduction](../front/intro.md). Alternate translation: “These people went out for the sake of the name, receiving nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, you will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of God.” 
1:7	d8y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ γὰρ τοῦ ὀνόματος ἐξῆλθον	1	Here, **the name** refers to Jesus. This could mean: (1) they left where they were in order to tell others about Jesus. (2) they left where they were because others forced them to leave because of their belief in Jesus. (3) both of these things. Alternate translation: “since they have gone out to tell people about Jesus”
1:7	yzc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲν λαμβάνοντες	1	This could mean: (1) unbelievers have not helped them by giving them anything. (2) they did not accept any help or gifts from unbelievers.
1:7	hk3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἐθνικῶν	1	Here, **Gentiles** does not mean people who are not Jewish. It refers to any people who do not trust in Jesus. Alternate translation: “unbelievers”
1:8	m0qy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	**Therefore** indicates that what follows is a result of what came before. In this case, **we ourselves** ought to help these people because “the Gentiles” (verse 7) do not help them. Use a connector in your language that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “This is why”
1:8	pgqr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & ὀφείλομεν	1	John is using **we ourselves** to refer to Gaius, himself, and all believers, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.
1:8	hdjg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπολαμβάνειν	1	The implication is that **to welcome** these people includes providing what they need for their journey. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to help” or “to support”
1:8	dw7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, **so that** marks becoming **fellow workers** as a goal or purpose of welcoming people **such as these**. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that this is a purpose. Alternate translation: “and in this way”
1:8	d2l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἵνα συνεργοὶ γινώμεθα τῇ ἀληθείᾳ	1	John is speaking as if the **truth** were a living thing that he and his fellow Christians could become **workers** for.

1:8	ab01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τῇ ἀληθείᾳ	1	Here, **the truth** is spoken of as though it were a person that John, Gaius, and others worked for.

1:9	dp1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	The word **us** is exclusive; it refers to John and those with him and does not include Gaius. It may also be a polite way for John to refer to himself. See the UST.
1:9	rrgg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Διοτρέφης, οὐκ ἐπιδέχεται ἡμᾶς	1	Saying **Diotrephes … does not accept us** does not mean that he has physically rejected John and those with John, but it is a shorter way of saying that he does not accept John’s authority or the instructions that John gives. Alternate translation: “Diotrephes … rejects our instructions”
1:10	lf4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	**For this reason** indicates that what follows is a result of what came before. Because Diotrephes “does not accept” John's authority (verse 9), John will expose his evil works when John comes. Use a connector in your language that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “Therefore” or “This is why”
1:10	w1yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐὰν ἔλθω	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “if I go to you”
1:10	prnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν ἔλθω	1	John speaks as if he were uncertain about this, but he means that he is planning to come. If your readers might think that what John is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as a confident statement. Alternate translation: “when I come” or “at the time that I come”
1:10	f6qj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	λόγοις πονηροῖς φλυαρῶν ἡμᾶς	1	John is speaking as if the **words** of Diotrephes were living things that could be morally **evil** themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that is, that he says evil things about us that certainly are not true”
1:10	wi6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὔτε αὐτὸς ἐπιδέχεται τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	John is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he does not welcome the fellow believers”
1:10	it7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τοὺς βουλομένους κωλύει	1	John leaves out words that are understood from the previous clause. You could supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and he stops the ones who are willing to receive the believers”
1:11	a3z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀγαπητέ	1	Here, **Beloved** is used as a term of endearment for Gaius as a fellow believer. See how you translated this in [3 John 1:5](../01/05.md).
1:11	pv24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	μὴ μιμοῦ τὸ κακὸν, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀγαθόν	1	John is using the adjectives **evil** and **good** as nouns in a general sense. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “do not imitate evil things that people do, but good things”
1:11	sz2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τὸ ἀγαθόν	1	John leaves out words that are understood from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “but imitate the good things that people do”
1:11	zan2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐχ ἑώρακεν τὸν Θεόν	1	“Seeing” here is a metaphor that stands for knowing or understanding. Alternate translation: “has not experienced God” or “has not believed in God”
1:12	pl7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Δημητρίῳ μεμαρτύρηται ὑπὸ πάντων	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “All who know Demetrius bear witness of him” or “Every believer who knows Demetrius speaks well of him”
1:12	m22h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Δημητρίῳ	1	**Demetrius** is a man. He may be someone in Gaius's congregation whom John wants Gaius to support as a leader rather than Diotrephes, or he may be the person who carried this letter to Gaius, and John is now introducing him to Gaius. 
1:12	n0v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μεμαρτύρηται	1	The implication is that this **witness** is of good things about Demetrius. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has been commended as a good person”
1:12	v69i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὑπὸ πάντων	1	John says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “by everyone who knows him”
1:12	mftm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ὑπὸ αὐτῆς τῆς ἀληθείας	1	John leaves out words that are understood from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “and he has been borne witness to by the truth itself”
1:12	rad4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	καὶ ὑπὸ αὐτῆς τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Here, John refers to **truth** as though it were a person speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everyone who knows the truth knows that he is a good person”
1:12	jogk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ὑπὸ αὐτῆς τῆς ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and by his right way of living”
1:12	s712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἡμεῖς δὲ μαρτυροῦμεν	1	As in the previous sentence, the implication here is also that this **witness** is of good things about Demetrius. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers.  Alternate translation: “And we also speak well of Demetrius”
1:12	a16a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & ἡμῶν	1	Here, **we** and **our** refer to John and those with him and do not include Gaius, so use the exclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:13	am6k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	οὐ θέλω διὰ μέλανος καὶ καλάμου σοι γράφειν	1	The expression **with ink and pen** contains extra information about the materials used for writing that would be considered understood and thus unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. John is not saying that he would write about these things with something other than ink and pen. He is saying that he does not wish to write about these things at all. Alternate translation: “I do not want to write about them to you”
1:14	r8i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	στόμα πρὸς στόμα	1	Here, **mouth to mouth** is an idiom meaning “in person.”  If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “face to face” or “in person”
1:15	v8yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	εἰρήνη σοι	1	John ends his letter with a blessing for Gaius. You could express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May God give you peace”
1:15	mhs1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσπάζονταί σε οἱ φίλοι	1	John assumes that Gaius will understand that he is referring to the believers who are with John. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The believers with me send their greetings to you”
1:15	lq8r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσπάζου τοὺς φίλους	1	John assumes that Gaius will understand that he is referring to the believers who are there with Gaius, and that he is to pass on the greetings to them from John and from the believers who are with John. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Greet the believers there for us”
1:15	dxln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατ’ ὄνομα	1	Here, **by name** is an idiom that means “personally.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “one by one” or “personally”
